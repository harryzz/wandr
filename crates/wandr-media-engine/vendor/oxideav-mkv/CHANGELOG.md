## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `examples/schema_validate.rs`: dev CLI printing a file's schema
  verdict, per-class counters, and every finding with offset + element
  name; exit 0 valid / 1 not valid / 2 usage. Black-box validated:
  audio-only Matroska and VP9+Opus WebM files from a widely-deployed
  muxer both report zero violations and zero informational findings.
- Fuzzing: fifth harness pass drives `schema::validate` over the same
  arbitrary bytes as the demux / resilient / `webm::scan` passes,
  asserting counter/findings consistency and `is_valid()` coherence;
  the seed corpus replays through it as a plain `cargo test`.
  Locally exercised 13.8M executions (bounded 2 min + 8 min runs)
  with zero findings.
- `schema::validate(reader) -> SchemaReport`: whole-document schema
  validation over the new table. Flags placement (`WrongParent`),
  type-shape/`length` (`BadLength`), decoded-value `range`
  (`OutOfRange`, full schema grammar incl. C hex-floats), occurrence
  (`TooManyOccurrences` / `MissingMandatory` — defaulted mandatory
  elements legally stay off-disk per RFC 8794 §11.1.6.2), `CRC-32`
  first-child placement (`MisplacedCrc32`), and `unknownsizeallowed`
  (`UnknownSizeNotAllowed`) violations, plus informational
  `UnknownId` / `KnownLegacy` (the removed Signature family,
  recognised and descended per the staged mapping doc) / `Deprecated`
  / `VersionMismatch` findings that do not fail `is_valid()`. O(file)/O(depth) structural walk, findings with
  absolute offsets capped at 4096, exact counters, damage surfaces as
  `scan_stopped_at`. The in-tree muxer's output validates with zero
  findings of any kind — pinned in CI. 10 tests in
  `tests/schema_validate.rs`.
- New `schema` module: the staged IETF CELLAR EBML Schema for Matroska
  (`ebml_matroska.xml`) wired in as a machine-readable validation
  table. `schema::SCHEMA` holds all 262 elements (id / name / path /
  parent / EBML type / minOccurs / maxOccurs / verbatim range-length-
  default constraints / minver-maxver window / recursive / recurring /
  unknownsizeallowed / WebM extension marker);
  `schema::EBML_SUPPLEMENT` adds the RFC 8794 header elements and the
  `Void` / `CRC-32` globals; `schema::element_def(id)` resolves across
  both. 7 census tests pin the table shape, path/parent consistency,
  the two-way `ids.rs` cross-census (post-RFC `minver: 5` and
  absent-by-design Signature exceptions documented), and the schema
  `webm` markers' corroboration of the guidelines support table.
- Muxer: RFC 9559 §25.2 SeekHead-expansion reservation
  (`MkvMuxer::with_seek_head_expansion_void(reserved_bytes)`).
  `write_header` writes a `Void` of exactly the requested size (>= 2)
  immediately after the SeekHead so a downstream editor can expand the
  SeekHead in place to cover late-added Tags / Chapters / Attachments;
  caller-sized per the §25.2 "size ... should be adjusted" note (one
  extra fixed-width Seek entry = 21 bytes). SeekPositions still land on
  their targets with the `Void` in between; conflicts with
  `with_live_streaming` both ways (§25.3.4 writes no SeekHead);
  in-profile under strict WebM. Read-back accessor
  `seek_head_expansion_void()`. 5 integration tests in
  `tests/mux_seek_head_expansion.rs`.
- Demuxer: zero-Cluster (metadata-only) Segments open. The schema gives
  `Cluster` no `minOccurs`, so a Segment with only Info / Tracks /
  Chapters / Tags / Attachments is legal; previously both open paths
  rejected it with "no clusters". Strict and resilient opens now
  succeed (zero `DamageEvent`s), non-Cluster masters surface through
  their usual accessors, `next_packet` reports a clean `Error::Eof`
  from the first call, and `seek_to` returns `Error::Unsupported` in
  both modes (the Cues path already did; the resilient Cues-less
  cluster-scan fallback now does too instead of scanning nothing). The
  in-tree muxer's zero-packet output round-trips. 5 integration tests
  in `tests/zero_cluster.rs`; the fuzz-regression pin in
  `tests/injection_robustness.rs` re-anchored on the no-panic contract
  it was actually protecting (its `is_err` assertion had been pinning
  the old zero-Cluster rejection).
- Demuxer: legacy pre-registry element handling per the staged
  legacy-element-ID mapping. `Edition::hidden` surfaces the legacy
  `EditionFlagHidden` (`0x45BD`, historical default `0` materialised);
  `Chapter::track_uids` surfaces the legacy `ChapterTrack` (`0x8F`) >
  `ChapterTrackUID` (`0x89`) TrackUID list in on-disk order (zeros
  dropped per the "not 0" range; empty = "all tracks apply"); and the
  removed global Signature family (`SignatureSlot` `0x1B538667` +
  children) is recognised and skipped as known-legacy — strict opens
  step over it, resilient opens record no `DamageEvent`, and the
  damaged-stream resync scanner can re-anchor on its four-octet ID.
  Read-side only; the muxer never emits any of the eleven elements. 6
  integration tests in `tests/legacy_elements.rs`.
- WebM conformance: the eleven guideline rows that previously could not
  be keyed to an Element ID (the legacy Signature family under
  `SignatureSlot` `0x1B538667`, `EditionFlagHidden` `0x45BD`,
  `ChapterTrack` `0x8F`, and `ChapterTrackNumber` — the schema's
  `ChapterTrackUID`, same ID `0x89`) are now mapped via the staged
  legacy-element-ID doc and classify `Unsupported` exactly as the
  guidelines table says, instead of falling through to `Unlisted`. The
  support table grows 239 → 250 rows (98 → 109 `Unsupported`); the
  `webm::scan` walker descends the four legacy masters so each child
  occurrence is flagged individually with its offset. `ids.rs` gains the
  eleven constants (never emitted by the muxer — the IDs are formally
  unassigned in the IANA registry, so writing them could collide with a
  future assignment) and the RFC 9559 census pins them as documented
  out-of-registry legacy exceptions.
- Muxer: front-`Cues` layout (`MkvMuxer::with_front_cues(reserved_bytes)`,
  RFC 9559 §25.3.3). `write_header` reserves a `Void` before the first
  Cluster; `write_trailer` writes the finished `Cues` into it (remainder
  covered by a filler `Void`; a 1-byte remainder absorbed by widening
  the `Cues` size VINT) and patches the SeekHead. A too-small
  reservation falls back to the ordinary end placement. Conflicts with
  `with_live_streaming` both ways; in-profile under strict WebM. 4
  integration tests in `tests/mux_front_cues.rs`;
  `examples/gen_webm_profile.rs` gained `--front-cues`.
- Demuxer: SeekHead-directed recovery of post-Cluster Top-Level masters
  (RFC 9559 §6.3). The open path follows `SeekHead > Seek` entries that
  reference a `Tags` / `Chapters` / `Attachments` / `Cues` master stored
  after the Cluster run — the common single-pass-mux layout — so late
  masters now surface at open time through the typed accessors, the flat
  metadata view, and the seek index (previously late Chapters /
  Attachments never surfaced and late Tags only after draining the
  stream). Trust-but-verify: the target must carry the promised element
  ID with a bounded body inside the Segment; parses land in temporaries
  merged only on success; already-parsed masters are never chased. 4
  integration tests in `tests/seek_head_directed_recovery.rs`.
- Muxer: RFC 9559 §25.1 Cluster **byte** budget. Clusters were already
  rotated at ~5 s; they now also rotate once the open Cluster's Block
  content reaches 5 MB (the other half of the §25.1 recommendation), so
  a high-bitrate stream no longer produces arbitrarily large Clusters.
  A Cluster exceeds the budget by at most one Block. New
  `MkvMuxer::with_cluster_limits(max_duration_ms, max_bytes)` tunes both
  budgets (duration validated against the Section 10 signed-16-bit
  Block-timestamp bound, bytes floored at 1024) and `cluster_limits()`
  reads them back. 5 integration tests in `tests/mux_cluster_limits.rs`.
- Fuzz harness: a fourth pass drives `webm::scan` over every input,
  asserting the per-status counters sum to `elements_scanned` and the
  findings-cap bookkeeping is consistent; the seed corpus also replays
  through the scanner as a deterministic `cargo test`
  (`webm_conformance::fuzz_corpus_seeds_replay_through_scan`).
- Muxer: two-pass Segment `Duration` finalization
  (`MkvMuxer::with_duration_finalization()`, RFC 9559 §5.1.2.10).
  `write_header` reserves an 11-byte `Void` inside `Info`;
  `write_trailer` patches the measured duration (max packet end time
  across streams, ms ticks) in place and rewrites the Info `CRC-32` the
  patch invalidates (RFC 8794 §11.3.1). A crashed producer or
  zero-packet mux truthfully leaves the `Void`. Conflicts rejected both
  ways with `set_duration` and `with_live_streaming`; works in strict
  WebM mode (no CRC child to rewrite, output stays scan-conformant).
  6 integration tests in `tests/mux_duration_finalization.rs`;
  `examples/gen_webm_profile.rs` gained `--finalize` for black-box
  validation.
- WebM muxer: strict profile gating by default. A `mux::open_webm` /
  `MkvMuxer::new_webm` muxer now emits only elements the WebM guidelines
  list as supported: off-profile queue-time setters return
  `Error::Unsupported` (Attachments, TrackOperation, TrackTranslate,
  legacy TrackEntry elements, Linked-Segment Info metadata,
  MaxBlockAdditionID, DefaultDecodedFieldDuration / TrackTimestampScale,
  AttachmentLink, ContentCompression + the signing quartet, off-profile
  chapter fields, edition/chapter/attachment Tag scopes), Top-Level
  masters carry no `CRC-32` child, the Cluster `Position` hint is
  suppressed (`PrevSize` survives), the chapters `EditionEntry` omits
  `EditionUID`, off-profile `BlockGroupOptions` fields are rejected, and
  a queued `SilentTracks` list errors at the next Cluster open — so
  `webm::scan(output).is_conformant()` holds. New
  `MkvMuxer::with_webm_lenient()` restores the previous full-surface
  behaviour under the `webm` DocType (rejected on a Matroska muxer);
  `MkvMuxer::webm_strict()` reports the mode. Matroska muxers are
  byte-identical with prior releases. 5 integration tests in
  `tests/mux_webm_profile.rs`.
- New `webm` module: WebM-profile conformance. `webm_element_support(id)`
  transcribes the staged WebM container guidelines' per-element support
  table by Element ID (239 rows: 137 Supported / 98 Unsupported / 4
  Deprecated; post-table elements → `Unlisted`), and `webm::scan(reader)`
  walks a whole EBML document classifying every element occurrence into a
  `WebmConformanceReport` — `DocType`, per-status counts, every
  Unsupported/Deprecated occurrence with absolute offset (capped at
  4096), distinct Unlisted IDs, damage stop-offset, and the
  `is_conformant()` headline verdict. Bounded and panic-free on hostile
  input (depth cap 64, findings cap, no leaf-body allocation); 12
  integration tests in `tests/webm_conformance.rs` + 4 unit tests.
- `tests/rfc9559_element_census.rs`: a full transcription of the RFC 9559
  Table 53 "Matroska Element IDs" registry (250 named entries, 43 of them
  Reclaimed, the 4 all-ones Reserved placeholders excluded) cross-checked
  against `src/ids.rs` in both directions — every registry element has a
  const, every numeric const is registry / RFC 8794 EBML-header set / the
  one documented legacy exception, const names agree with the registry
  Element Names, no Reserved ID is defined, and every ID sits inside the
  Section 27.1 valid VINT ID classes. Pins the "every element in the
  RFC 9559 element-ID registry is read and written" claim in CI.

### Fixed

- Attribution hygiene for `ChapterFlagEnabled` (id `0x4598`): the crate's
  docs cited RFC 9559 chapter sections for it, but RFC 9559 dropped the
  element (Table 53 leaves `0x4598` unassigned; the ChapterAtom sections
  jump from ChapterFlagHidden §5.1.7.1.4.5 to ChapterSegmentUUID
  §5.1.7.1.4.6). It is now documented as the legacy pre-RFC ecosystem
  element it is — behaviour unchanged (read + round-tripped, historical
  default `1` materialised).

### Other

- Marked the internal `ebml` module (raw VINT/element walker plumbing used by
  the in-crate property tests) `#[doc(hidden)]` so semver tooling tracks only
  the supported container API; no behavioural or signature changes.

### Added

- Muxer: `ChapterDisplay` gained a `language_bcp47: Option<String>` field
  writing `ChapLanguageBCP47` (RFC 9559 §5.1.7.1.4.11, id `0x437D`). When set,
  the muxer writes the BCP-47 tag in place of `ChapLanguage` (which the spec
  says MUST be ignored when the BCP-47 form is present), mirroring the
  `LanguageBCP47` / `TagLanguageBCP47` handling. Closes the last
  `ChapterDisplay` demux-reads-but-mux-can't-write gap. 2 round-trip cases in
  `tests/mux_chapter_language_bcp47.rs`. (Adds a field to the public
  `mux::ChapterDisplay`; it now derives `Default`.)
- Muxer: `MkvMuxer::set_block_addition_mappings(stream_index, Vec<BlockAdditionMapping>)`
  writes the track-level `BlockAdditionMapping` masters (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.17
  — `BlockAddIDValue` / `BlockAddIDName` / `BlockAddIDType` /
  `BlockAddIDExtraData`) into the carrying `TrackEntry`, in slice order. Takes
  the same demux-side `BlockAdditionMapping` records the reader surfaces, so a
  mux→demux pipeline round-trips every mapping element-for-element. Per-field
  omission mirrors the decode (`value`/`name`/`extra_data` write only when
  `Some`; `BlockAddIDType` only when non-zero, the §5.1.4.1.17.3 `0` default
  staying off-disk yet round-tripping as `0`). Closes the last `TrackEntry`
  side-channel-declaration demux-reads-but-mux-can't-write gap. 6 round-trip
  cases in `tests/mux_block_addition_mapping.rs`.
- Muxer: `MkvMuxer::set_duration(std::time::Duration)` writes the Segment
  `Duration` (RFC 9559 §5.1.2.10, id `0x4489`) — the total Segment length as a
  `float` in `TimestampScale` ticks (= ms at the muxer's fixed 1 ms scale) —
  into the CRC-validated `Info` body between `TimestampScale` and `DateUTC`.
  The muxer never auto-derives it (Clusters stream with the unknown-size VINT
  and the `Info` `CRC-32` is sealed at header time, so a trailer patch would
  invalidate that CRC); a caller supplies the known total length and it
  round-trips through the demuxer's `duration_micros()`. The §5.1.2.10
  `> 0x0p+0` range is enforced. Closes the last `Info`-master
  demux-reads-but-mux-can't-write gap. Round-trips pinned in
  `tests/mux_duration.rs` (5 cases, incl. Info-CRC-still-validates).
- Muxer: `MkvMuxer::set_track_codec_timing(stream_index, MkvTrackCodecTiming)`
  writes the `TrackEntry`-level `CodecDelay` (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.25) and
  `SeekPreRoll` (§5.1.4.1.26) elements on **any** track. Each field is an
  `Option<u64>` nanosecond value — a `Some(v)` writes the element explicitly
  (an explicit `0` round-trips distinctly from omission, since neither element
  has a "not 0" range), a `None` leaves it off-disk. For an Opus track the
  muxer still auto-derives `CodecDelay` from the `OpusHead` pre-skip and an
  80 ms `SeekPreRoll`; an explicit hint now overrides either auto value per
  field, closing the last demux-reads-but-mux-can't-write asymmetry on the
  codec-timing surface. Fully symmetric with the demux-side
  `MkvDemuxer::track_codec_timing`. Round-trips pinned in
  `tests/mux_track_codec_timing.rs` (7 cases).

### Fixed

- Demuxer: fuzz-found add-overflow (debug-build panic) when a nested master
  that computes a bounded body end — `Colour`, `Projection`,
  `MasteringMetadata`, `ChapterTranslate` — carries the EBML unknown-size
  VINT. RFC 8794 §6.2 permits the unknown-size sentinel only on elements
  whose schema declares `unknownsizeallowed` (Segment / Cluster in RFC
  9559), so the forged size now saturates and the unbounded child walk
  fails cleanly at EoF instead of panicking on `pos + u64::MAX`. Crash
  input preserved as `fuzz/corpus/demux/regression_colour_unknown_size.bin`
  plus three shape-targeted `injection_robustness` tests.

### Added

- Demuxer + Muxer: RFC 9559 §23.2 live tagging — mid-stream `Tags`. The
  demuxer now parses a `Tags` element it crosses during the Cluster walk
  and applies the §23.2 MUST-reset ("the new Tags element MUST reset the
  previously encountered Tags elements and use the new values instead"):
  the typed `tags()` slice is replaced wholesale and the tag-derived
  flat-metadata entries are swapped in place, leaving Info- / Chapters- /
  Attachments-derived metadata untouched; UID scopes resolve against the
  same maps the open-time walk built, and a leading `CRC-32` on the
  element validates onto `crc_status()` like every other Top-Level
  master. The same read path surfaces a *trailing* `Tags` element placed
  after the last Cluster — a common Writer layout the single-pass open
  walk never reached before (previously skipped silently). A malformed
  mid-stream `Tags` is skipped without resetting anything. On the write
  side, `MkvMuxer::write_live_tags(&[MkvTag])` (livestreaming muxers
  only) emits a `Tags` element between Clusters with the same queue-time
  validation as `add_tag`, flushing in-flight laces and ending the open
  unknown-size Cluster (the top-level element terminates it on read).

- Muxer: livestreaming layout (RFC 9559 §25.3.4 + §23.2) —
  `MkvMuxer::with_live_streaming()` omits the up-front `SeekHead` and
  writes no `Cues` in `write_trailer` ("SeekHead and Cues are useless" in
  a live stream; a stream with neither at its start SHOULD read as
  non-seekable per §23.2 — the signal a live producer wants). Everything
  other than Clusters still lands before the Clusters as §25.3.4
  requires, and the Segment / Cluster unknown-size VINTs §23.2 mandates
  were already the muxer's default, so the output can be cut at any
  Cluster boundary. Combined with `with_cluster_position_hints()`, each
  Cluster's `Position` is written as `0` (the §5.1.3.2 live convention)
  while `PrevSize` stays real. Pairs with the resilient demuxer: a live
  capture cut at an arbitrary byte still demuxes its packet prefix and
  stays seekable through the Cues-less Cluster-Timestamp fallback (both
  pinned by tests). Black-box validated (live file probes and fully
  decodes cleanly under a widely-deployed reader); the
  `gen_position_hints` example gained a `--live` flag.

- Fuzzing: the `demux` fuzz target gained a third pass through
  `open_resilient_typed`, enforcing the resilient contract over arbitrary
  bytes — a resilient `next_packet` may only fail with the clean
  `Error::Eof` (anything else panics the harness), recovery bookkeeping
  never moves backwards, and both `seek_to` shapes (Cues and the
  Cues-less cluster-scan fallback) are exercised post-drain. Two new
  corpus seeds (mid-file corruption, 60% truncation) plus a `cargo test`
  corpus replay that runs every seed through the resilient path.

- Muxer: opt-in per-Cluster damage-recovery / backward-play hints —
  `MkvMuxer::with_cluster_position_hints()` writes a `Position` child
  (RFC 9559 §5.1.3.2, the Cluster's own Segment Position — "It might help
  to resynchronize the offset on damaged streams") right after every
  Cluster's `Timestamp`, plus a `PrevSize` child (§5.1.3.3, the previous
  Cluster's full element size in octets — "useful for backward playing")
  from the second Cluster on. Off by default so output stays
  byte-identical with prior releases. Round-trip tests verify the
  semantics exactly (each `Position` + Segment payload start + header
  length lands on the Cluster's on-disk ID; each Cluster start minus its
  `PrevSize` lands on the previous Cluster's ID), including after a
  damage resync; black-box validated (hinted file probes and fully
  decodes cleanly under a widely-deployed reader). Ships with the
  `gen_position_hints` example used for that validation.

- Demuxer: resilient Cues-less seek fallback — on an [`open_resilient`]
  demuxer, `seek_to` on a file with no usable `Cues` index (absent, or the
  master was damaged and skipped at open) linearly scans Cluster
  `Timestamp`s (RFC 9559 §5.1.3.1) and lands on the last Cluster at or
  before the target, honouring the §11.1 ascending-Cluster-time order to
  stop early. RFC 9559 §22.1 only RECOMMENDS `Cues`, so a Cues-less file
  is legal; the strict path still returns `Error::Unsupported` unchanged.
  Unknown-size Clusters (whose end is only defined by the next sibling)
  are stepped over with the same vetted Top-Level scan the resync path
  uses. Targets before the first / after the last Cluster snap to the
  first / last Cluster, mirroring the Cues path's first-cue fallback.

- Demuxer: damage-resilient open — `demux::open_resilient` /
  `demux::open_resilient_typed`. RFC 9559 §26 leaves error handling to the
  Reader; this Reader recovers instead of failing: a known-size Segment
  whose declared size runs past the input end is clamped (truncated-file
  recovery), a damaged Top-Level master before the first Cluster (`Tags`,
  `Chapters`, `Cues`, ...) is skipped keeping whatever parsed before the
  error, garbage between Top-Level elements is stepped over by scanning
  for the next well-formed 4-byte Top-Level element ID, and a corrupt
  element inside the Cluster stream makes `next_packet` resynchronise on
  the next plausible Cluster (the §5.1.3.2 damaged-stream
  resynchronisation unit — a candidate must parse and its first child must
  carry a legal Cluster-child ID per the §5.1.3.1 usage note) rather than
  ending the stream. A truncated final Cluster yields the packets that
  physically fit, then a clean `Error::Eof`. Every recovery is recorded as
  a typed `DamageEvent` (`DamagedMaster(id)` / `GarbageData` /
  `ClusterStream` / `SegmentTruncated` / `UnrecoverableTail`, each with
  the damage offset, resume offset, and bytes skipped) surfaced through
  `MkvDemuxer::damage_events()` — empty exactly when the file needed no
  recovery, so strict-minded callers can still reject after the fact. The
  strict `open` / `open_typed` behaviour is unchanged byte-for-byte;
  `tests/damage_resilience.rs` pins both paths, including an
  every-truncation-point packet-prefix property sweep.

- Demuxer + Muxer: three reclaimed DivX-font `AttachedFile` children
  (RFC 9559 Appendix A.40..A.42) on the typed `demux::Attachment` and
  `mux::MkvAttachment` — `FileReferral` (A.40, `0x4675`, binary),
  `FileUsedStartTime` (A.41, `0x4661`, uinteger), and `FileUsedEndTime`
  (A.42, `0x4662`, uinteger). Read verbatim and written only when supplied,
  so a non-DivX attachment stays clean and a mux→demux pipeline round-trips
  a present-but-empty referral (`Some(vec![])`) and an explicit `0` used-time
  (`Some(0)`) without collapsing either to absent. `MkvAttachment` now derives
  `Default` over the extended field set; struct-literal constructions take
  `..Default::default()`.
- Demuxer: `TagDefaultBogus` (RFC 9559 Appendix A.43, `0x44B4`) is read as a
  synonym for `TagDefault` (`0x4484`) so a `SimpleTag` written by a historical
  Writer that emitted the mis-encoded id still surfaces its default flag.
- `ids`: modern RFC 9559 element-name aliases for the legacy-named id
  constants the spec renamed without changing the on-wire id —
  `FILE_MEDIA_TYPE` (= `FILE_MIME_TYPE`, `0x4660`), `TIMESTAMP_SCALE`
  (= `TIMECODE_SCALE`, `0x2AD7B1`), `TIMESTAMP` (= `TIMECODE`, `0xE7`),
  `SEGMENT_UUID` (= `SEGMENT_UID`), `PREV_UUID` (= `PREV_UID`), and
  `NEXT_UUID` (= `NEXT_UID`). Spec-name-oriented callers resolve the same
  constants the original names already provided.
- Demuxer: `EncryptedBlock` (RFC 9559 Appendix A.15, `0xAF`) Cluster-level
  reclaimed element — its raw, still-Transformed (encrypted/signed) body now
  surfaces on `ClusterRecord::encrypted_blocks` (in on-disk order) instead of
  being skipped silently. The container performs no decryption and the element
  yields no `Packet` (its track header is inside the Transformed region); the
  bytes are exposed verbatim for a caller that decrypts itself or re-muxes a
  legacy stream.

- Demuxer + Muxer: three reclaimed Video/Audio-master legacy elements on
  `TrackLegacy` / `MkvTrackLegacy` (RFC 9559 Appendix A.25..A.27) — `GammaValue`
  (A.25, `0x2FB523`, float, Video), `FrameRate` (A.26, `0x2383E3`, float, Video
  — informational fps, never used for timing by the container), and
  `ChannelPositions` (A.27, `0x7D7B`, binary, Audio — per-channel horizontal
  angles). Surfaced verbatim from / written into the enclosing `Video` / `Audio`
  master for a faithful re-mux; a mux→demux pipeline round-trips them. The
  floats mean `TrackLegacy` / `MkvTrackLegacy` now derive `PartialEq` only (no
  longer `Eq`).

- Muxer: write side for the reclaimed `BlockGroup` children (RFC 9559 Appendix
  A.3..A.14) — `BlockGroupOptions` gains `block_virtual`, `reference_virtual`,
  `slices` (a `Vec<TimeSlice>` written as one `Slices` master) and
  `reference_frame` (`ReferenceFrame`), the symmetric counterpart of the
  demux-side `BlockGroupMeta`. `TimeSlice::from_fields` / `ReferenceFrame::from_fields`
  constructors let a caller build the masters; only populated fields reach the
  disk, and an empty `TimeSlice` still preserves the on-disk element count. A
  mux→demux pipeline round-trips every populated reclaimed child.

- Demuxer + Muxer: three more reclaimed `TrackEntry`-level legacy elements on
  `TrackLegacy` / `MkvTrackLegacy` (RFC 9559 Appendix A.16..A.18) — `MinCache`
  (A.16, `0x6DE7`, uinteger), `MaxCache` (A.17, `0x6DF8`, uinteger), and
  `TrackOffset` (A.18, `0x537F`, signed integer, Matroska-Tick playback-offset
  adjustment). Each is a pure on-disk projection surfaced verbatim for a
  faithful re-mux (`None` = absent, present `0` = `Some(0)`); the container
  applies none of them. The muxer writes the populated fields via
  `set_track_legacy`, so a mux→demux pipeline round-trips them — including a
  signed/zero `TrackOffset` and an explicit `MinCache = 0`.

- Demuxer: reclaimed DivX trick-track / old-lacing `BlockGroup` children
  (RFC 9559 Appendix A.3..A.14) on `BlockGroupMeta`, surfaced for a faithful
  re-mux. `block_group_meta()` now also exposes `block_virtual()`
  (`BlockVirtual`, A.3 binary), `reference_virtual()` (`ReferenceVirtual`, A.4
  integer — Segment Position of a virtual Block's data), `slices()` (every
  `Slices > TimeSlice` master, A.5..A.11, each a new `TimeSlice` folding
  `LaceNumber` / `FrameNumber` / `BlockAdditionID` / `Delay` / `SliceDuration`),
  and `reference_frame()` (`ReferenceFrame`, A.12..A.14 — `ReferenceOffset` +
  `ReferenceTimestamp` for a Smooth FF/RW trick track). Every field is a pure
  on-disk projection (`None`/empty = absent, present `0` = `Some(0)`); none is
  interpreted by the container. New public types `TimeSlice` + `ReferenceFrame`.

- Demuxer + Muxer: EBML-header `DocTypeExtension` surface (RFC 8794 §11.2,
  including §11.2.9..§11.2.11). `MkvDemuxer::ebml_header() -> &EbmlHeader`
  surfaces the full parsed header — the `EBMLVersion` / `EBMLReadVersion` /
  `EBMLMaxIDLength` / `EBMLMaxSizeLength` quartet (§11.2.2..§11.2.5, spec
  defaults `1` / `1` / `4` / `8` materialised when absent), `doc_type`, the
  `doc_type_version` /
  `doc_type_read_version` pair (spec default `1` materialised when absent), and
  every well-formed `DocTypeExtension` (name + version) in document order; a
  malformed extension missing either mandatory child is dropped at parse time.
  `MkvMuxer::set_doc_type_extensions(Vec<DocTypeExtension>)` writes the
  declarations into the EBML header, with queue-time validation for empty
  names, zero versions, duplicate names, and post-`write_header` use. A
  header→header copy round-trips every extension verbatim. New public types
  `EbmlHeader` + `DocTypeExtension`.

- Demuxer + Muxer: legacy `Video > OldStereoMode` (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.28.5, id
  `0x53B9`, `maxver 2`) — the "bogus" stereo-3D mode value libmatroska prior to
  0.9.0 wrote at the wrong Element ID (`0x53B9` instead of `0x53B8`, §18.10).
  `MkvDemuxer::video_old_stereo_mode(stream_index) -> Option<OldStereoMode>`
  (+ the `video_old_stereo_modes()` slice) surfaces it through a new typed enum
  (`Mono` / `RightEye` / `LeftEye` / `BothEyes` / `Other(u64)`) kept separate
  from the modern `StereoMode` because their value spaces (Table 7 vs Table 5)
  are incompatible; no spec default is materialised, so absence reads `None`.
  `MkvMuxer::set_video_old_stereo_mode(stream_index, OldStereoMode)` writes it
  inside the `Video` master as a legacy / re-mux-only surface (omitted by
  default, since a Writer MUST NOT emit it for new files). A mux→demux pipeline
  round-trips the value bit-exactly. This closes the **last** RFC 9559
  element-ID-registry entry the crate had not yet read or written — every
  registry element is now both decoded and writable.

- Muxer: Segment `Info` metadata write surface — `Title` (RFC 9559 §5.1.2.12)
  and `DateUTC` (§5.1.2.11). `MkvMuxer::set_title(impl Into<String>)` queues
  the Segment's general name; `set_date_utc_ns(i64)` queues the creation date
  as signed nanoseconds since the Matroska epoch (2001-01-01T00:00:00 UTC, the
  `date` element type), with `set_date_utc_unix_secs(i64)` rebasing a Unix
  timestamp onto that epoch (pre-2001 instants yield a negative, still-valid
  `DateUTC`). Both land in the `Info` master in §5.1.2 element order (after
  `TimestampScale`, before `MuxingApp`) and round-trip onto the demuxer's flat
  metadata view (`"title"` / `"date"`). The `date` writer fixes the on-disk
  width at 8 bytes (the only legal `date` length). All three setters reject
  post-`write_header` use; omitting them writes neither element.

- Muxer: Linked-Segment `Info` write surface (RFC 9559 §5.1.2.1..§5.1.2.8 +
  Section 17) — `MkvMuxer::set_segment_linking(SegmentLinking)` queues the
  `SegmentUUID` / `SegmentFilename` / `PrevUUID` / `PrevFilename` / `NextUUID`
  / `NextFilename` / `SegmentFamily`(s) / `ChapterTranslate`(s) children, and
  the muxer materialises them into the `Info` master in §5.1.2 element order
  (before `TimestampScale`). The mux-side mirror of the existing demux-side
  `MkvDemuxer::segment_linking()` accessor, so a demuxed `SegmentLinking`
  round-trips through the muxer byte-for-byte. The setter enforces the §5.1.2
  spec rules: the 128-bit UID elements are `length: 16` (§5.1.2.1 / .3 / .5 /
  .7 — an off-length UID is rejected); `PrevUUID` / `NextUUID` MUST NOT equal
  `SegmentUUID` (§5.1.2.3 / .5); a `SegmentFamily` is REQUIRED when a
  `ChapterTranslate` is present (§5.1.2.7 usage note); each `ChapterTranslate`
  carries a non-empty `ChapterTranslateID` (§5.1.2.8.1, `minOccurs: 1`). The
  read-only `segment_linking()` accessor exposes the queued record before the
  header is sealed. An all-default record writes nothing (standalone Segment).
- Demuxer: typed `TrackIdentity` accessor (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.18 / .19 / .20 /
  .23 / .4 / .5 / .12 / .24). `MkvDemuxer::track_identity(stream_index)` (and
  the per-stream `all_track_identity()` slice) folds eight `TrackEntry`-level
  identity / selection elements — `Name` (§5.1.4.1.18), `Language`
  (§5.1.4.1.19), `LanguageBCP47` (§5.1.4.1.20), `CodecName` (§5.1.4.1.23),
  `FlagEnabled` (§5.1.4.1.4), `FlagDefault` (§5.1.4.1.5), `FlagLacing`
  (§5.1.4.1.12), and `AttachmentLink` (§5.1.4.1.24) — into one record per
  track. The four strings carry no spec default and stay `Option`; the three
  selection flags carry the spec default `1`, materialised on
  `enabled()` / `default()` / `lacing_allowed()` while the `*_explicit`
  accessors preserve the on-disk presence; `AttachmentLink` is a "not 0"
  uinteger (a spec-illegal `0` is dropped). `language()` honours the
  §5.1.4.1.20 precedence — `LanguageBCP47` supersedes `Language` — while
  `language_matroska()` / `language_bcp47()` expose each raw form; `uses_bcp47()`
  reports the precedence. The effective language now also lifts onto the flat
  `StreamInfo` view with BCP-47 taking precedence. `is_default()` reports the
  all-absent state.
- Muxer: `TrackEntry` identity / selection writing (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.18 /
  .19 / .20 / .23 / .4 / .5 / .12 / .24). New
  `MkvMuxer::set_track_identity(stream_index, MkvTrackIdentity)` queues a
  per-track hint whose eight `Option` slots — `name` (`Name`), `codec_name`
  (`CodecName`), `language` (`Language`), `language_bcp47` (`LanguageBCP47`),
  `flag_enabled` (`FlagEnabled`), `flag_default` (`FlagDefault`),
  `flag_lacing` (`FlagLacing`), `attachment_link` (`AttachmentLink`) — land
  directly inside the `TrackEntry` at `write_header` time. Per-field omission
  rule: each `Some(v)` writes the element, each `None` stays off-disk. The
  `language` field overrides the `StreamInfo`-derived `Language`; the
  `flag_lacing` field overrides the auto-derived value. Per §5.1.4.1.20, when
  both `language` and `language_bcp47` are `Some` the muxer writes only
  `LanguageBCP47` (`Language` MUST be ignored when BCP-47 is present).
  Queue-time validation rejects an empty `Name` / `CodecName` / `Language` /
  `LanguageBCP47` string, `attachment_link == Some(0)` (§5.1.4.1.24 "not 0"),
  an out-of-range `stream_index`, and any call after `write_header`.
  Convenience constructors `MkvTrackIdentity::named` / `::language_bcp47` /
  `::non_default`, plus a read-back `MkvMuxer::track_identity` accessor. Pairs
  symmetrically with the demux-side `MkvDemuxer::track_identity` — a mux→demux
  pipeline round-trips every element.
- Muxer: `Tags` writing (RFC 9559 §5.1.8). New `MkvMuxer::add_tag(MkvTag)`
  queues metadata descriptors emitted as the file's single `Tags` master
  before the first `Cluster`, symmetric with the long-standing demux-side
  `tags()` read surface. `MkvTag` pairs an `MkvTagTargets` scope
  (`TargetTypeValue` §5.1.8.1.1.1, `TargetType` §5.1.8.1.1.2, and the four
  `TagTrackUID` / `TagEditionUID` / `TagChapterUID` / `TagAttachmentUID`
  lists §5.1.8.1.1.3..§5.1.8.1.1.6 — multi-UID scoping supported) with one
  or more `MkvSimpleTag` `(name, value)` descriptors carrying `TagName`
  (§5.1.8.1.2.1), `TagLanguage` (§5.1.8.1.2.2, default `und` omitted),
  `TagLanguageBCP47` (§5.1.8.1.2.3, wins over `TagLanguage`), `TagDefault`
  (§5.1.8.1.2.4, default `1` written only when cleared), and a
  `TagString` (§5.1.8.1.2.5) / `TagBinary` (§5.1.8.1.2.6) payload enum.
  `MkvSimpleTag` supports the spec's `recursive: True` nesting via a
  `children` list. Convenience constructors `MkvTag::global`,
  `MkvTagTargets::track`, `MkvSimpleTag::new` / `::binary`. Queue-time
  validation rejects an empty `simple_tags` list (§5.1.8.1.2 `minOccurs:
  1`), an empty `TagName` at any nesting depth (§5.1.8.1.2.1), a
  `TargetTypeValue == 0` (`range: not 0`), and any call after
  `write_header`. The `Tags` master carries a leading `CRC-32` child
  (§6.2) and is reachable from a new `SeekHead` `Tags` slot (voided when
  no tags are queued). Covered by `tests/mux_tags.rs` (16 round-trip
  cases through the demuxer's flat `metadata()` and typed `tags()` views).
- Demuxer: nested `SimpleTag` parsing (RFC 9559 §5.1.8.1.2 `recursive:
  True`). `SimpleTag` gains a `children: Vec<SimpleTag>` field; the
  `tags()` accessor now surfaces child `SimpleTag`s instead of silently
  dropping them, so a hierarchical tag (e.g. a `TITLE` carrying a
  `SORT_WITH` sub-tag, or a name-only `ARTISTS` parent with `ARTIST`
  leaves) round-trips through a mux→demux pipeline. Parsed up to a fixed
  16-level depth cap; name-less children are dropped per the
  §5.1.8.1.2.1 `minOccurs: 1` rule. Nested descriptors stay out of the
  flat `metadata()` view (which only ever surfaced top-level
  descriptors). Two `tests/mux_tags.rs` cases cover the round-trip.
- Tests: two `tests/injection_robustness.rs` cases for the nested-tag
  parser — a 4000-level-deep nested `SimpleTag` chain that must parse
  without a stack overflow (proving the §5.1.8.1.2 `recursive` depth
  cap), and a name-less nested `SimpleTag` that must be dropped
  (§5.1.8.1.2.1 `minOccurs: 1`) while its named parent survives.
- Demuxer: `CueBlockNumber` seek fallback (RFC 9559 §5.1.5.1.2.5). When a
  Cues entry carries a `CueBlockNumber` ("Number of the Block in the
  specified Cluster") but no `CueRelativePosition` (§5.1.5.1.2.3) — common
  for files indexed by older tools — `seek_to` now walks the Cluster body
  counting `SimpleBlock` / `BlockGroup` elements and lands the reader on
  the exact 1-based n-th Block instead of falling back to a cluster-start
  scan. Out-of-range / malformed block numbers degrade gracefully to the
  cluster-start walk (no panic). The flat seek index and the typed
  `cue_points()` view both carry `CueBlockNumber` now. Covered by
  `tests/cue_block_number_seek.rs`.
- Muxer: per-frame subtitle cue emission (RFC 9559 §22.1 — "each subtitle
  frame SHOULD be referenced by a CuePoint element with a CueDuration
  element"). A `MediaType::Subtitle` track is now indexed once per *frame*
  rather than once per *cluster*: every subtitle Block gets its own
  `CuePoint` carrying the frame's `CueDuration` (§5.1.5.1.2.4) and a
  distinct `CueBlockNumber` (§5.1.5.1.2.5). Audio/video indexing is
  unchanged (one cue per cluster — §22.1's "at most once every 500 ms"
  guidance for audio, keyframes for video). Covered by
  `tests/mux_subtitle_cues.rs`, including a regression guard that audio is
  still indexed once per cluster.
- Muxer: complete the `Cues` write surface to match the demuxer's read
  surface. Every `CueTrackPositions` the muxer emits now carries
  `CueBlockNumber` (RFC 9559 §5.1.5.1.2.5) — the 1-based ordinal of the
  indexed Block within its Cluster, counting every `SimpleBlock` /
  `BlockGroup` across all tracks in write order, so a cue on a Block that
  is not first in its Cluster is now expressible (`range: not 0` honoured —
  the first Block is number 1). When the indexed packet carried a usable
  duration, `CueDuration` (§5.1.5.1.2.4, in Segment Ticks) is written too;
  §22.1 specifically recommends it for subtitle cues. Both values
  round-trip through the typed `demux::MkvDemuxer::cue_points()` view
  (`tests/mux_cue_block_number.rs`). Previously the muxer wrote only
  `CueTime` / `CueTrack` / `CueClusterPosition` / `CueRelativePosition`.
- Property-style test coverage for the EBML element walker (RFC 8794) in
  `tests/ebml_walker_property.rs` — a seeded splitmix64 PRNG drives ~100k
  generated cases per run (no `proptest`/`quickcheck` dependency, keeping
  the clean-room surface minimal). Pins: VINT `write_vint`↔`read_vint`
  round-trip with `min_width` honoured across the full 56-bit range; the
  unknown-size sentinel at every width (1..8); `read_element_header`
  round-trip with `header_len` accounting; a sequential `read_element_header`
  + `skip` walk recovering every element id and landing exactly on the
  buffer end; and no-panic / no-backward-seek on arbitrary byte streams and
  every prefix of a well-formed tree. Complements the existing
  demux-only libFuzzer target in `fuzz/`.
- Muxer: complete `ChapterAtom` write surface (RFC 9559 §5.1.7.1.4). The
  `mux::MkvChapter` struct now carries the atom fields the writer previously
  dropped — `uid` (§5.1.7.1.4.1, auto-derived non-zero when `None`),
  `string_uid` (§5.1.7.1.4.2), `hidden` (§5.1.7.1.4.5),
  `enabled` (§5.1.7.1.4, default `1` materialised, written only when
  cleared), `segment_uuid` (§5.1.7.1.4.6, 16-byte), `segment_edition_uid`
  (§5.1.7.1.4.7), `physical_equiv` (§5.1.7.1.4.8) — plus the
  `ChapProcess > ChapProcessCommand` chapter-codec command tree
  (§5.1.7.1.4.14..§5.1.7.1.4.19) via new `mux::MkvChapProcess` /
  `mux::MkvChapProcessCommand`, the write-side mirror of the existing
  `demux::ChapProcess` / `demux::ChapProcessCommand` read surface. The full
  atom + process tree round-trips through the typed `MkvDemuxer::chapters()`.
  `add_chapter_full` rejects `ChapterUID 0` / `ChapterSegmentEditionUID 0`
  (range "not 0") and a non-16-byte `ChapterSegmentUUID`. New
  `tests/mux_chapter_process.rs` (5 cases). `MkvChapter` gained a manual
  `Default` (so `..Default::default()` works while keeping `enabled = true`).
- `SilentTracks` (RFC 9559 Appendix A.1 / A.2, ids `0x5854` / `0x58D7`),
  read **and** write. Demuxer: a new `ClusterRecord::silent_track_numbers`
  field surfaces the per-Cluster list of `SilentTrackNumber` values (the
  track numbers "not used in that part of the stream") in on-disk order,
  empty for the common case of a Cluster without the element. Muxer:
  `MkvMuxer::set_next_cluster_silent_tracks(&[u64])` queues the list for the
  next Cluster the muxer opens, draining it after one Cluster to match the
  element's per-Cluster scope (A.2: a track silent here MAY be active again
  later); `MkvMuxer::track_number(stream_index)` maps a stream index to the
  assigned on-wire `TrackNumber` so callers can build the list. The element
  is deprecated (`maxver: 0`) but emitted by historical Writers, so both
  paths exist for faithful inspection / re-mux. Covered by
  `tests/silent_tracks.rs` (4 round-trip cases). `ClusterRecord` is no longer
  `Copy` (it now owns a `Vec`); it stays `Clone`.
- BlockGroup meta surface (RFC 9559 §5.1.3.5.4..§5.1.3.5.7), read **and**
  write. Demuxer: `MkvDemuxer::block_group_meta() -> Option<&demux::BlockGroupMeta>`
  folds the four non-`Block`, non-`BlockAdditions` `BlockGroup` children the
  `Packet` type has no slot for — `ReferenceBlock` (§5.1.3.5.5, every value, in
  on-disk order; was previously read only to flip the keyframe flag and then
  discarded), `ReferencePriority` (§5.1.3.5.4, spec default `0` materialised),
  `CodecState` (§5.1.3.5.6, verbatim codec-private bytes), `DiscardPadding`
  (§5.1.3.5.7, signed Matroska Ticks). Same call discipline as
  `block_additions()` (read after `next_packet()`, invalidated by `seek_to`).
  Muxer: `MkvMuxer::write_packet_with_block_group(&Packet, &mux::BlockGroupOptions)`
  writes the full group child set in §5.1.3.5 order, deriving a single
  `ReferenceBlock` from the previous same-track Block when the caller leaves the
  list empty for a non-keyframe (the prior `write_packet_with_additions`
  behaviour) and writing the caller's explicit references verbatim otherwise.
  An empty `BlockAdditions` no longer emits a malformed empty master, and a
  group whose only child is e.g. `DiscardPadding` needs no `MaxBlockAdditionID`
  declaration. New `ids::{REFERENCE_PRIORITY, CODEC_STATE, DISCARD_PADDING,
  SILENT_TRACKS, SILENT_TRACK_NUMBER}`. Covered by `tests/mux_block_group.rs`
  (5 round-trip cases).
- Demuxer: typed `SeekHead` accessor (RFC 9559 §5.1.1, including
  §5.1.1.1..§5.1.1.1.2). `MkvDemuxer::seek_entries() -> &[demux::SeekEntry]`
  surfaces the MetaSeek index — the `SeekHead > Seek` rows that point each
  Top-Level Element to its Segment Position — in document order. Each
  `SeekEntry` pairs a `SeekID` (§5.1.1.1.1, the 4-byte binary EBML ID of the
  referenced element, decoded via `seek_id() -> Option<u32>` and preserved
  verbatim via `seek_id_bytes()`) with a `SeekPosition` (§5.1.1.1.2, a Segment
  Position per Section 16, via `seek_position()` + `has_position()`). The
  demuxer doesn't navigate by the SeekHead — it walks Segment children directly
  and seeks via `Cues` — so this is a pure inspection / re-mux surface, the one
  Top-Level master that was CRC-validated but never read back. A malformed
  `Seek` missing its mandatory `SeekPosition` is surfaced for inspection
  (`seek_position() == 0`, `has_position() == false`) rather than dropped;
  a `SeekID` referencing an unrecognised element round-trips verbatim; the §6.3
  two-`SeekHead` layout (`maxOccurs: 2`) accumulates both SeekHeads' entries
  onto one slice. The in-tree muxer's emitted SeekHead (Info / Tracks / Cues)
  reads back through this accessor with every `SeekPosition + segment_data_start`
  landing on the matching on-disk element header. Returns an empty slice when
  the file carries no `SeekHead`.

- Demuxer + Muxer: `TrackTranslate` (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.27, id `0x6624`) — the
  per-`TrackEntry` chapter-codec track-mapping master, the `TrackEntry`-level
  twin of `Info > ChapterTranslate`. The demuxer surfaces each mapping through
  `MkvDemuxer::track_translates(stream_index) -> &[demux::TrackTranslate]` (and
  the per-stream `all_track_translates()` slice) — `track_id`
  (`TrackTranslateTrackID`, binary, verbatim), `codec` (`TrackTranslateCodec`),
  and the unbounded `edition_uids` (`TrackTranslateEditionUID`) list, in on-disk
  order, empty for tracks with no mapping. The muxer writes the masters via
  `MkvMuxer::set_track_translates(stream_index, Vec<mux::MkvTrackTranslate>)`
  (convenience constructor `MkvTrackTranslate::new(track_id, codec)`), enforcing
  the spec rules at queue time (mandatory non-empty `track_id`, "not 0" edition
  UIDs, pre-`write_header` only, in-range stream). A mux→demux pipeline
  round-trips every mapping field-for-field.

- Demuxer + Muxer: the reclaimed content-signing quartet inside
  `ContentEncryption` (RFC 9559 Appendix A.33..A.36 — `ContentSignature`
  `0x47E3`, `ContentSigKeyID` `0x47E4`, `ContentSigAlgo` `0x47E5`,
  `ContentSigHashAlgo` `0x47E6`). The `demux::ContentEncodingTransform::Encryption`
  variant gains a `signing: ContentSigning` field surfacing the four elements
  verbatim — `signature` / `key_id` as `Option<Vec<u8>>`, `algo` / `hash_algo`
  as `Option<u64>` — where `None` means the element was absent on disk (the
  appendix defines no values and no defaults, so a present `0` round-trips as
  `Some(0)` distinct from absence). `ContentSigning::is_empty()` reports the
  all-absent state. The muxer writes each child only when its `Option` slot is
  `Some`, so an empty `ContentSigning` adds no bytes and round-trips to `None`
  on every field. The container is a pure carrier: it never computes or
  verifies a signature.
- Muxer: `ContentEncodings` (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.31) write path via
  `MkvMuxer::set_track_content_encodings(stream_index, ContentEncodings)`.
  Serialises the per-track compression / encryption chain
  (`ContentEncoding` → `ContentEncodingOrder` / `ContentEncodingScope` /
  `ContentEncodingType` + `ContentCompression` / `ContentEncryption`
  sub-masters) as a `ContentEncodings` master inside the `TrackEntry`,
  taking the same `demux::ContentEncodings` record the demuxer produces
  for a byte-exact round-trip. Adds `to_raw()` inverses on the
  `demux::ContentCompAlgo` / `ContentEncAlgo` / `AesCipherMode` enums
  (Table 23 / 24 / 26, including each `Other(u64)` forward-compat value).
  Queue-time validation enforces order uniqueness (§5.1.4.1.31.2), non-zero
  scope (§5.1.4.1.31.3), the AES-only / non-zero `AESSettingsCipherMode`
  rules (Table 25 / §5.1.4.1.31.12), a non-empty chain, in-range stream
  index, and pre-`write_header` use. The container carries the declared
  chain but does not compress or encrypt the frame bytes. Pairs
  symmetrically with `MkvDemuxer::content_encodings`.
- Demuxer: Linked-Segment `Info` metadata (RFC 9559 §5.1.2.1..§5.1.2.8 +
  Section 17), exposed via `MkvDemuxer::segment_linking()` returning a typed
  `demux::SegmentLinking`. Parses `SegmentUUID`, `SegmentFilename`,
  `PrevUUID`/`PrevFilename`, `NextUUID`/`NextFilename`, the unbounded
  `SegmentFamily` UID list, and the `ChapterTranslate` sub-tree
  (`ChapterTranslateID` / `ChapterTranslateCodec` / `ChapterTranslateEditionUID`)
  as `demux::ChapterTranslate`. UID binaries are kept verbatim (off-length
  values round-trip for inspection); `is_empty()` / `is_hard_linked()`
  convenience predicates added.

- mux: **`TrackOperation` on write** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.30). New `MkvMuxer::set_track_operation(stream_index, MkvTrackOperation)` queues a per-track virtual-track recipe that lands as a `TrackOperation` master (id `0xE2`) directly inside the carrying `TrackEntry` (sibling to `Video` / `Audio`) at `write_header` time. `MkvTrackOperation` carries a `combine_planes: Vec<MkvTrackPlane>` (`TrackCombinePlanes`, §5.1.4.1.30.1 — each `MkvTrackPlane` pairs a 0-indexed source `stream_index` with a `TrackPlaneType`, §5.1.4.1.30.4) and a `join_tracks: Vec<usize>` (`TrackJoinBlocks`, §5.1.4.1.30.5). Each plane / join reference's stream index is resolved to the source track's on-disk `TrackUID` at write time — the symmetric inverse of the demux side, which resolves each `TrackPlaneUID` (§5.1.4.1.30.3) / `TrackJoinUID` (§5.1.4.1.30.6) back to a stream index. The demux-side `TrackPlaneType` enum gained a `to_raw()` inverse so every Table 20 value (`LeftEye` / `RightEye` / `Background`) round-trips, including the `Other(u64)` forward-compat variant (§27.17 leaves the "Matroska Track Plane Types" registry open). Both operation kinds may coexist on one track. Convenience constructors `MkvTrackOperation::stereo_3d(left, right)` (the canonical left/right-eye 3D recipe) and `MkvTrackOperation::join(streams)` cover the two common shapes. Spec rules enforced at queue time: rejects post-`write_header` use, out-of-range `stream_index`, an empty operation (`TrackCombinePlanes` / `TrackJoinBlocks` exist only to carry references), and any plane / join reference pointing at a non-existent stream (the `TrackPlaneUID` / `TrackJoinUID` "not 0" pins, §5.1.4.1.30.3 / §5.1.4.1.30.6, fall out of the stream-index→`TrackUID` mapping). Unlike the `set_video_*` family there is no track-type restriction — the spec carries `TrackOperation` on every `TrackEntry`, so a `TrackJoinBlocks` audio virtual track is accepted. Omitting the call keeps the master off-disk so the demuxer surfaces `None` from `track_operation`. The muxer pins `DocTypeVersion` to `4`, comfortably above §5.1.4.1.30's `minver: 3`. Pairs symmetrically with the existing `MkvDemuxer::track_operation` typed accessor — a mux→demux pipeline preserves every plane (with its type) and every join reference. Covered by `tests/mux_track_operation.rs` (14 cases: combine-planes 3D, background + `Other` plane type, join-blocks, coexisting combine+join, omitted-call `None`, on-disk-id presence, all five queue-time rejections, accessor read-back, last-write-wins, non-video acceptance).

- demux: **typed `Cues` accessor** (RFC 9559 §5.1.5.1, including §5.1.5.1.1..§5.1.5.1.2.8 and the reclaimed Appendix A.37..A.39 `CueReference` children). New `MkvDemuxer::cue_points() -> &[CuePoint]` surfaces the full on-disk seek-index tree in document order — the structure the denormalised `seek_to` index (track / time / cluster offset / relative position) collapses. Each `CuePoint` pairs `CueTime` (id `0xB3`, §5.1.5.1.1 — absolute timestamp in Segment Ticks, not microseconds) with one or more `CueTrackPositions` (id `0xB7`, §5.1.5.1.2 — `minOccurs: 1`, no `maxOccurs`, so a single timestamp can index blocks on several tracks). The new typed `CueTrackPositions` record exposes `track` (`CueTrack`, id `0xF7`, §5.1.5.1.2.1), `cluster_position` (`CueClusterPosition`, id `0xF1`, §5.1.5.1.2.2, `Option<u64>`), `relative_position` (`CueRelativePosition`, id `0xF0`, §5.1.5.1.2.3, `Option<u64>`), `duration` (`CueDuration`, id `0xB2`, §5.1.5.1.2.4, `Option<u64>`), `block_number` (`CueBlockNumber`, id `0x5378`, §5.1.5.1.2.5, `Option<u64>`), `codec_state` (`CueCodecState`, id `0xEA`, §5.1.5.1.2.6, `u64` with spec default `0` materialised — `0` meaning "taken from the initial `TrackEntry`"), and `references` (`CueReference`, id `0xDB`, §5.1.5.1.2.7, `Vec<CueReference>`). The new typed `CueReference` record exposes `ref_time` (`CueRefTime`, id `0x96`, §5.1.5.1.2.8) plus the reclaimed-appendix `ref_cluster` (`CueRefCluster`, id `0x97`, A.37), `ref_number` (`CueRefNumber`, id `0x535F`, A.38), and `ref_codec_state` (`CueRefCodecState`, id `0xEB`, A.39), each `Option<u64>` (the reclaimed appendix lists no defaults). The index is populated whether the `Cues` element sits before the first Cluster or after the last (the late best-effort `scan_cues_from` rescan feeds the same typed collector); unknown children inside `CueTrackPositions` are skipped for forward-compat; the denormalised seek path is unchanged. New `ids::CUE_CODEC_STATE` / `CUE_REFERENCE` / `CUE_REF_TIME` / `CUE_REF_CLUSTER` / `CUE_REF_NUMBER` / `CUE_REF_CODEC_STATE` constants plumb the element ids through. Pinned by 12 new `tests/cue_points.rs` cases: the no-Cues empty-slice surface, the spec-minimum mandatory-pair-only CuePoint (every optional child at absence / default), an all-sub-elements round-trip (every documented child including a full `CueReference`), a minimal `CueReference` (only mandatory `CueRefTime`, reclaimed children `None`), multiple `CueReference` rows preserved in document order, multiple `CueTrackPositions` per CuePoint indexing two tracks at one timestamp, multiple CuePoints in document order, the index-at-end (`scan_cues_from`) layout carrying `CueDuration` / `CueBlockNumber`, unknown-child skip inside `CueTrackPositions`, the explicit-`0` `CueCodecState` default case, the typed-view-stable-across-packet-walk contract, and the `CuePoint::default()` / `CueTrackPositions::default()` shape.
- demux: **`TrackEntry` codec-timing pair** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.25 + §5.1.4.1.26 — `CodecDelay` id `0x56AA`, `SeekPreRoll` id `0x56BB`). New typed accessor `MkvDemuxer::track_codec_timing(stream_index) -> Option<&TrackCodecTiming>` (plus the per-stream `all_track_codec_timing()` slice) folds the two elements — which sit directly on `TrackEntry`, not in a gating master — into one record per track, so every valid track surfaces a record and the accessor returns `None` only for an out-of-range index. Both are nanosecond (Matroska Tick) `uinteger`s: `codec_delay()` is the encoder's built-in delay (Opus pre-skip) the player MUST subtract from each frame timestamp, `seek_pre_roll()` is the audio the decoder MUST decode after a seek before its output is valid (Opus convention 80 ms). Unlike the §5.1.4.1.13/.14 durations, both carry spec default `0` and **no** "not 0" range, so an explicit on-disk `0` is a legal value distinct from "absent": the plain accessors materialise the `0` default while `codec_delay_explicit()` / `seek_pre_roll_explicit()` preserve the on-disk presence so a re-muxer can avoid emitting an element the source omitted. `TrackCodecTiming::is_empty()` reports the both-absent state — a track that emitted an explicit `0` for either element is *not* empty. The mux side already wrote both on the Opus path; this lands the symmetric demux-side read. New coverage in `tests/track_codec_timing.rs` (6 demux-side tests).
- demux + mux: **`TrackEntry` timing trio** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.13..§5.1.4.1.15 — `DefaultDuration` id `0x23E383`, `DefaultDecodedFieldDuration` id `0x234E7A`, `TrackTimestampScale` id `0x23314F`). New typed accessor `MkvDemuxer::track_timing(stream_index) -> Option<&TrackTiming>` (plus the per-stream `all_track_timing()` slice) folds the three elements — which sit directly on `TrackEntry`, not in a gating master — into one record per track. `DefaultDuration` is the container's nominal nanoseconds-per-frame source; `TrackTiming::nominal_frame_rate()` derives fps (`1e9 / ns`). Both nanosecond durations carry a "not 0" range and no spec default, so they stay `Option<u64>` and a spec-illegal explicit `0` is dropped at parse time. `TrackTimestampScale` is a `float` with default `1.0` and range `> 0x0p+0`; `track_timestamp_scale()` materialises the default while `track_timestamp_scale_explicit()` preserves the on-disk presence (a non-finite / non-positive payload is dropped). `TrackTiming::is_empty()` reports the all-absent state. The mux side gains the symmetric `MkvMuxer::set_track_timing(stream_index, MkvTrackTiming)` builder with per-field omission (each `Some(v)` written explicitly, each `None` off-disk), spec-range checks at queue time (`0` durations and `<= 0`/non-finite scale rejected), no track-type restriction (the elements sit on `TrackEntry`), last-write-wins, a pre-`write_header` read-back accessor, and a `MkvTrackTiming::from_frame_rate(fps)` convenience constructor (rounds `1e9/fps` to ns, rejects non-finite/non-positive). A mux→demux pipeline preserves every supplied child bit-exactly. New coverage in `tests/track_timing.rs` (9 demux-side tests) and `tests/mux_track_timing.rs` (11 round-trip + rejection tests).
- mux: **write-side `Video > AspectRatioType`** (RFC 9559 Appendix A.24, reclaimed, id `0x54B3`) via the new `MkvMuxer::set_video_aspect_ratio_type(stream_index, u64)` builder method. The demux side already read this reclaimed appendix element (surfaced through `MkvDemuxer::video_aspect_ratio_type` as a raw `Option<u64>`); the new setter completes the round-trip. The element is a `uinteger` whose appendix documents it only as "Specifies the possible modifications to the aspect ratio" and enumerates no values and no default, so the setter takes the raw `u64` verbatim and the mux side never synthesises an enum — mirroring the demux-side surface. Per-element omission rule: the element is written into the track's `Video` master at `write_header` time only when the caller opts in; an explicit `0` is written and round-trips as `Some(0)`, distinct from absence (`None`), since the appendix defines no default to materialise. Spec rules enforced at queue time: the setter rejects post-`write_header` use, out-of-range `stream_index`, and calls on non-video tracks (only `Video` tracks carry a `Video` master). Read-back accessor `MkvMuxer::video_aspect_ratio_type` surfaces the queued hint pre-`write_header`; repeated calls are last-write-wins. This closes the last `Video` sub-element that the demux side read but the mux side could not write — the `Video` sub-element set is now fully symmetric across demux and mux. New round-trip + rejection coverage in `tests/mux_video_aspect_ratio_type.rs` (11 tests).

- mux: **write-side `Audio` master children** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.29, including §5.1.4.1.29.1..§5.1.4.1.29.4) via the new `MkvMuxer::set_track_audio(stream_index, MkvTrackAudio)` builder method and the new `MkvTrackAudio` payload struct (mux module). Before this round the muxer derived the per-track `Audio` master (id `0xE1`) solely from `StreamInfo` — `sample_rate` → `SamplingFrequency` (id `0xB5`, §5.1.4.1.29.1), `channels` → `Channels` (id `0x9F`, §5.1.4.1.29.3), sample-format bit width → `BitDepth` (id `0x6264`, §5.1.4.1.29.4) — and had **no** way to emit `OutputSamplingFrequency` (id `0x78B5`, §5.1.4.1.29.2), the Spectral Band Replication (SBR) output rate that the demux-side `MkvDemuxer::track_audio` / `TrackAudio::is_sbr()` accessor already read back. The new setter closes that asymmetry: each of the four `Option` fields, when `Some(v)`, overrides the `StreamInfo`-derived child; when `None`, defers to the `StreamInfo` value (and for `output_sampling_frequency`, simply omits the element since `StreamInfo` has no equivalent). Children that resolve to nothing stay off-disk so the demuxer materialises the §5.1.4.1.29.1 default `8000.0` / §5.1.4.1.29.3 default `1` (mono); `BitDepth` has no spec default so its absence surfaces as `None`. The convenience constructor `MkvTrackAudio::sbr(core_sampling_frequency)` produces the canonical HE-AAC pair (`core`, `2 * core`). Spec range checks enforced at queue time: `SamplingFrequency` / `OutputSamplingFrequency` are ranged `> 0x0p+0` (a `Some(v)` with `v <= 0.0` or non-finite is rejected), `Channels` and `BitDepth` are ranged `not 0` (a `Some(0)` is rejected). Track-type restriction mirrors the demux side, which returns `None` from `track_audio` for non-audio tracks: the setter rejects calls on non-`Audio` streams, plus post-`write_header` use and out-of-range `stream_index`; repeated calls are last-write-wins; the read-back `MkvMuxer::track_audio(stream_index)` accessor returns the queued hint pre-`write_header`. Pairs symmetrically with the existing demux-side `MkvDemuxer::track_audio` typed accessor — a mux→demux round-trip preserves every supplied child bit-exactly, including the `OutputSamplingFrequency` SBR signal. Pinned by 12 new `tests/mux_track_audio.rs` cases: the no-hint StreamInfo-derived round-trip (48 kHz / 2ch / 16-bit, no `OutputSamplingFrequency` on disk, `is_sbr()` false), explicit-hint override of all three StreamInfo children, the SBR round-trip (22050 → 44100, `is_sbr()` firing, channels/bit_depth deferred), the `sbr()` constructor, the `0x78B5` on-disk presence scan (present when set / absent both with no hint and with a hint that left it `None`), the bare-StreamInfo fallback to §5.1.4.1.29.1 / .3 spec defaults, last-write-wins, all four rejection contracts (post-`write_header` → `Error::Other`; out-of-range, non-audio, and each range violation → `Error::InvalidData`), and the pre-`write_header` accessor read-back.
- demux+mux: **per-Block `BlockAdditions` typed views** (RFC 9559 §5.1.3.5.2, including §5.1.3.5.2.1..§5.1.3.5.2.3) **+ `MaxBlockAdditionID`** (§5.1.4.1.16), read AND write. Read side: the `BlockGroup` walk now parses the `BlockAdditions` master (id `0x75A1`) it previously skipped — each `BlockMore` (id `0xA6`, §5.1.3.5.2.1) decodes into the new typed `BlockAddition` record pairing `block_add_id()` (`BlockAddID`, id `0xEE`, §5.1.3.5.2.3 — spec default `1` = codec-defined materialised on omission; `is_codec_defined()` convenience) with the verbatim `data()` bytes (`BlockAdditional`, id `0xA5`, §5.1.3.5.2.2 — "interpreted by the codec as it wishes", never parsed by the container). The new `MkvDemuxer::block_additions() -> &[BlockAddition]` accessor surfaces the additions attached to the most recently returned packet (the out-queue now carries an `Arc`-shared additions slot per packet): empty for `SimpleBlock` packets (the element only exists on `BlockGroup`), for `BlockGroup`s without the master, before the first `next_packet`, and after a `seek_to`; every frame de-laced from one laced Block shares the Block's additions (the spec attaches the master to the Block as a whole). Malformed `BlockMore`s are dropped: missing mandatory `BlockAdditional`, `BlockAddID == 0` (range "not 0"), duplicate `BlockAddID` (§5.1.3.5.2.3 uniqueness MUST — first occurrence kept). The TrackEntry walk also gains `MaxBlockAdditionID` (id `0x55EE`, §5.1.4.1.16), surfaced via `MkvDemuxer::max_block_addition_id(stream_index) -> Option<u64>` with the spec default `0` ("there is no BlockAdditions for this track") materialised on absence. This completes the side-channel story the existing typed surfaces pointed at: `AlphaMode::Present` (§5.1.4.1.28.4) names the `BlockAddID = 1` payload and `BlockAdditionMapping` (§5.1.4.1.17) describes ids `>= 2`, but the per-Block bytes themselves were unreachable until now. Write side: new `MkvMuxer::write_packet_with_additions(&packet, &[MkvBlockAddition])` emits the packet as a `BlockGroup` — `Block` (frame bytes, unlaced; a pending same-track lace is flushed first so Block order is preserved, and the cue index records the group exactly like the non-lacing fast path), `BlockAdditions` with one `BlockMore` per addition in slice order (`BlockAdditional` verbatim, `BlockAddID` written only when it differs from the §5.1.3.5.2.3 default `1`), `BlockDuration` (§5.1.3.5.3) when the packet carries a duration (a `SimpleBlock` could not have carried one — so the packet duration now round-trips), and `ReferenceBlock` (§5.1.3.5.5, new minimal-length signed-integer element writer per RFC 8794 §7.1) when the packet is not a keyframe — a plain `Block` has no KEY flag bit, keyframe-ness is the element's absence; the relative value points at the track's most recently written Block (newly tracked per stream), falling back to the spec-sanctioned `0` "necessary reference Block(s) is unknown". Prerequisite + validation (all before any byte is written): `MkvMuxer::set_max_block_addition_id(stream_index, max)` must declare a non-zero maximum before `write_header` (lands as the `MaxBlockAdditionID` TrackEntry element; explicit `0` writes byte-distinctly but decodes like absence); `write_packet_with_additions` rejects an undeclared stream (§5.1.4.1.16 default `0` = "no BlockAdditions"), `BlockAddID == 0`, ids above the declared maximum, and duplicate ids within one call. An empty additions slice degrades to plain `write_packet` (`BlockMore` is mandatory inside the master). `MkvBlockAddition::codec_defined(data)` covers the `BlockAddID = 1` shape (e.g. WebM alpha — pair with `set_video_alpha_mode`). Pinned by 11 new cases: 5 in `tests/block_additions.rs` (hand-built bytes — disk-order surfacing with the default-id materialisation, SimpleBlock/plain-group empty surface without leak-forward, all three malformed-`BlockMore` drops, Xiph-laced frames sharing one Block's additions, `MaxBlockAdditionID` explicit/absent/out-of-range) and 6 in `tests/mux_block_additions.rs` (full mux→demux round-trip incl. duration + on-disk id scans for `0x75A1`/`0x55EE`, keyframe-vs-`ReferenceBlock` round-trip both ways, empty-slice degradation with no master on disk, every rejection contract, lace-flush ordering end-to-end, explicit-zero declaration on disk but still gating writes).
- mux: **write-side TrackEntry audience flags** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.6..§5.1.4.1.11) via the new `MkvMuxer::set_track_audience_flags(stream_index, MkvTrackAudienceFlags)` builder method and the new `MkvTrackAudienceFlags` payload struct (mux module). Emits the six TrackEntry-level uinteger elements — `FlagForced` (id `0x55AA`, §5.1.4.1.6), `FlagHearingImpaired` (id `0x55AB`, §5.1.4.1.7), `FlagVisualImpaired` (id `0x55AC`, §5.1.4.1.8), `FlagTextDescriptions` (id `0x55AD`, §5.1.4.1.9), `FlagOriginal` (id `0x55AE`, §5.1.4.1.10), `FlagCommentary` (id `0x55AF`, §5.1.4.1.11) — directly inside the `TrackEntry` (the spec puts them on `TrackEntry` itself, not in a sub-master) at `write_header` time, after `FlagLacing`, in numerical-id order. Every payload slot is `Option<bool>` with a uniform omission rule (`Some(v)` writes the element explicitly as `0`/`1`; `None` keeps it off-disk) whose on-disk consequences split along the spec's asymmetric defaults: `FlagForced` carries the §5.1.4.1.6 default `0`, so `Some(false)` decodes identically to absence but is byte-distinct (the explicit producer-override path, matching the existing `StereoMode::Mono` explicit-write precedent); the five `minver: 4` flags carry no default, so `Some(false)` round-trips as `Some(false)` — distinct from `None` — preserving the §5.1.4.1.7..§5.1.4.1.11 "set to 1 *if and only if* …" explicit-zero signal end-to-end. Unlike the `set_video_*` family there is no track-type restriction: audio / video / subtitle tracks all accept the call, because the spec carries the elements on every `TrackEntry` (`FlagForced` with `minOccurs: 1`) and the demux-side accessor already surfaces a record for every track; §5.1.4.1.6's "applies only to subtitles" note describes player semantics, not an on-disk placement constraint. The muxer's existing `DocTypeVersion = 4` pin makes the `minver: 4` emissions version-consistent. Convenience constructors `MkvTrackAudienceFlags::forced_subtitle()` / `hearing_impaired_track()` / `visual_impaired_track()` / `commentary_track()` cover the common single-flag shapes; `is_empty()` reports the all-`None` no-op record (legal to queue — writes nothing). Spec rules enforced at queue time: rejects post-`write_header` use and out-of-range `stream_index`; repeated calls are last-write-wins; the read-back `MkvMuxer::track_audience_flags(stream_index)` accessor returns the queued record pre-`write_header`. Pairs symmetrically with the existing demux-side `MkvDemuxer::track_audience_flags` typed accessor — a mux→demux round-trip preserves every explicit flag, including the `Some(false)`-vs-absent distinction on the `minver: 4` five. Pinned by 13 new `tests/mux_track_audience_flags.rs` cases covering the forced-subtitle round-trip on a video+subtitle file (with on-disk id-byte scan for `0x55AA`), the explicit `FlagForced=0` still-writes-the-element contract, the omitted-call surface scanning all six ids absent + the demuxer materialising the §5.1.4.1.6 default `false` / five `None`s, all five `minver: 4` flags `Some(true)` together (ids `0x55AB`..`0x55AF` present, `0x55AA` absent, `is_accessibility()` firing), the `Some(false)`-distinct-from-`None` hearing-impaired case, audience flags accepted on both audio and video tracks, multi-track record independence, the all-`None` no-op record, last-write-wins overwrite, the pre-`write_header` accessor read-back, both rejection contracts (post-`write_header` → `Error::Other`, out-of-range index → `Error::InvalidData`), and the convenience-constructor shapes.
- mux: **write-side `Video > Projection` master** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.28.41, including the §5.1.4.1.28.42..§5.1.4.1.28.46 sub-elements) via the new `MkvMuxer::set_video_projection(stream_index, MkvProjection)` builder method and the new `MkvProjection` payload struct (mux module). Emits a `Projection` master (id `0x7670`) inside the per-track `Video` master at `write_header` time, after the `Colour` master, carrying `ProjectionType` (id `0x7671`), `ProjectionPrivate` (id `0x7672`), and the `ProjectionPose{Yaw,Pitch,Roll}` triple (ids `0x7673` / `0x7674` / `0x7675`). New `ProjectionType::to_raw()` inverse method on the demux-side enum round-trips every Table 18 value (`Rectangular` / `Equirectangular` / `Cubemap` / `Mesh`) plus the `Other(u64)` forward-compat variant (§27.15 leaves the "Matroska Projection Types" registry open). Per-element omission rules implemented at write time: `ProjectionType` is written only for non-`Rectangular` types (the §5.1.4.1.28.42 default `0` stays off-disk so the demuxer materialises it); each `ProjectionPose*` child is written as an 8-byte big-endian `f64` only when non-zero (the §5.1.4.1.28.44..46 default `0.0` stays off-disk); `ProjectionPrivate` is written only when `private` is `Some(_)` and reaches disk verbatim (the muxer never interprets the ISOBMFF box body). Children are written in numerical-id order so the on-disk layout matches the order the demuxer walks them. As a result, queueing `MkvProjection::default()` writes an empty `Projection` master (present-but-childless) which the demuxer parses into `Some(Projection::default())` with every getter at its spec default (rectangular, zero pose, no private) — distinguishable on disk from the call-was-omitted case, which keeps the `Projection` master off-disk so the demuxer surfaces `None` from `video_projection`. Convenience constructors `MkvProjection::equirectangular(private)` (the common 360° VR shape carrying the verbatim `equi` box body) and `MkvProjection::rotated(roll_degrees)` (the §5.1.4.1.28.46 worked example — a flat rectangular track signalling a counter-clockwise roll) cover the two common shapes. Spec rules enforced at queue time: `set_video_projection` rejects calls made after `write_header`, out-of-range `stream_index`, and calls on non-video tracks. Pairs symmetrically with the existing demux-side `MkvDemuxer::video_projection` typed accessor — a mux→demux round-trip preserves the projection record (type, pose, and verbatim `ProjectionPrivate` payload) bit-exactly. This closes the `Projection` write-side gap previously called out in the `## What's NOT implemented` README section. Pinned by 12 new `tests/mux_video_projection.rs` cases covering the equirectangular + private + full yaw/pitch/roll pose round-trip, the cubemap + private round-trip with zero pose, the `ProjectionType::Other(99)` forward-compat passthrough, the §5.1.4.1.28.46 roll-only worked example, the omitted-call `None` surface, the empty-`Projection`-master `Some(default)` surface with an on-disk id-byte scan for `0x7670`, on-disk element-id presence/absence, every rejection contract (post-`write_header`, out-of-range stream index, audio-track), idempotent last-write-wins under repeated calls, and the muxer's own `video_projection(stream_index)` accessor returning the queued value pre-`write_header`.
- demux: **typed `TrackAudio` accessor** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.29.1..§5.1.4.1.29.4). New `MkvDemuxer::track_audio(stream_index) -> Option<&TrackAudio>` (and the all-streams `all_track_audio() -> &[Option<TrackAudio>]`) folds the four `Audio` sub-master children — `SamplingFrequency` (id `0xB5`, §5.1.4.1.29.1), `OutputSamplingFrequency` (id `0x78B5`, §5.1.4.1.29.2), `Channels` (id `0x9F`, §5.1.4.1.29.3), `BitDepth` (id `0x6264`, §5.1.4.1.29.4) — into one typed record per audio track. Spec defaults are materialised asymmetrically: `TrackAudio::sampling_frequency() -> f64` always reflects the §5.1.4.1.29.1 default `0x1.f4p+12` = `8000.0` (an `Audio` master with no explicit child still surfaces 8000.0 Hz, never `0.0`); `TrackAudio::channels() -> u64` always reflects the §5.1.4.1.29.3 default `1` (mono); `TrackAudio::output_sampling_frequency() -> f64` folds Table 19's derived default (= `sampling_frequency()` when the element was absent) but `TrackAudio::output_sampling_frequency_explicit() -> Option<f64>` preserves the on-disk presence so a re-muxer doesn't materialise an element that wasn't in the source; `TrackAudio::bit_depth() -> Option<u64>` stays optional — §5.1.4.1.29.4 defines no default. Convenience predicate `TrackAudio::is_sbr()` returns `true` exactly when the writer emitted an explicit `OutputSamplingFrequency` strictly greater than `SamplingFrequency` (the canonical SBR-doubling signal for HE-AAC and similar tracks); equal-on-disk does NOT fire `is_sbr()`. Records surface only for `TrackEntry`s that carried an `Audio` master at all — video / subtitle / button tracks (where the master is `maxOccurs: 1` but carries no `minOccurs` at the `TrackEntry` level) return `None`, as does a malformed audio track that emitted no `Audio` child; the typed surface never synthesises a record from the §5.1.4.1.29.1 / .3 defaults alone. New `ids::OUTPUT_SAMPLING_FREQUENCY` reachability — `parse_audio` now reads `0x78B5` into the typed staging record alongside the existing `SamplingFrequency` / `Channels` / `BitDepth` flat-field writes the `CodecParameters::audio` builder consumes (no consumer behaviour change). Pinned by 13 new `tests/track_audio.rs` cases covering the all-default `Audio`-master-with-empty-body surface (sampling 8000.0 Hz + derived-default 8000.0 Hz output + 1 channel + `None` bit_depth + `!is_sbr`), explicit `SamplingFrequency=48000.0` round-trip, an f32 (4-byte float) `SamplingFrequency=44100.0` payload, explicit `OutputSamplingFrequency=44100.0` paired with `SamplingFrequency=22050.0` firing `is_sbr()` and `output_sampling_frequency_explicit() == Some(44100.0)`, equal explicit `OutputSamplingFrequency==SamplingFrequency` NOT firing `is_sbr()` while still recording `Some(48000.0)` (distinguishable from absent), explicit `Channels=6` (5.1) round-trip with `SamplingFrequency` keeping its 8000.0 default, explicit `BitDepth=24` round-trip, all four children set together (48 kHz / 48 kHz output / stereo / 16-bit / no SBR), an audio track without an `Audio` sub-master surfacing `None` (pathological-but-tolerated case), a video track surfacing `None`, a mixed audio+video file with `track_audio(0)` populated and `track_audio(1)` empty, an out-of-range `stream_index` returning `None` without panic, and a slice-mirror cross-check confirming `all_track_audio()[idx].as_ref() == track_audio(idx)` for every populated index.
- demux: **typed `TrackAudienceFlags` accessor** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.6..§5.1.4.1.11). New `MkvDemuxer::track_audience_flags(stream_index) -> Option<&TrackAudienceFlags>` (and the all-streams `all_track_audience_flags() -> &[TrackAudienceFlags]`) folds the six per-`TrackEntry` audience flags — `FlagForced` (id `0x55AA`, §5.1.4.1.6), `FlagHearingImpaired` (id `0x55AB`, §5.1.4.1.7), `FlagVisualImpaired` (id `0x55AC`, §5.1.4.1.8), `FlagTextDescriptions` (id `0x55AD`, §5.1.4.1.9), `FlagOriginal` (id `0x55AE`, §5.1.4.1.10), `FlagCommentary` (id `0x55AF`, §5.1.4.1.11) — into one typed record per stream. Spec defaults are materialised asymmetrically: `TrackAudienceFlags::forced() -> bool` always reflects the §5.1.4.1.6 default `0` (a `TrackEntry` with no `FlagForced` child decodes `false`), while the five `minver: 4` flags carry no spec default and surface as `Option<bool>` so callers can distinguish "writer was silent" (`None`) from "writer explicitly cleared the flag" (`Some(false)`) — the §5.1.4.1.7..§5.1.4.1.11 wording ("Set to 1 *if and only if* …") makes that distinction load-bearing. Convenience predicates: `is_default_presentation()` returns `true` when no flag sets a `Some(true)` (a quick filter for vanilla content tracks), `is_accessibility()` returns `true` when any of `hearing_impaired` / `visual_impaired` / `text_descriptions` is explicitly set. Every track surfaces a record — `FlagForced`'s "applies only to subtitles" note doesn't suppress the surface on audio / video tracks because the spec puts the elements on `TrackEntry` itself with `minOccurs: 1` for `FlagForced`; the typed surface trusts the caller to apply each flag where it makes sense for the track's `TrackType` / `CodecID`. New `ids::FLAG_FORCED` / `ids::FLAG_HEARING_IMPAIRED` / `ids::FLAG_VISUAL_IMPAIRED` / `ids::FLAG_TEXT_DESCRIPTIONS` / `ids::FLAG_ORIGINAL` / `ids::FLAG_COMMENTARY` constants plumb the element ids through to the `TrackEntry` walker. Pinned by 10 new `tests/track_audience_flags.rs` cases covering the all-absent default-materialisation surface (`forced == false` + all-`None`), explicit `FlagForced=1` on a subtitle track, explicit `FlagForced=0` observationally indistinguishable from absent (since the spec default *is* `0`), explicit `FlagHearingImpaired=1` + its `is_accessibility()` predicate, explicit `FlagHearingImpaired=0` distinct from absent (`Some(false)` vs `None`), all five `minver: 4` flags set together independently, multi-track files surfacing one record per stream-index, out-of-range stream index returning `None`, `TrackAudienceFlags::default()` matching the empty-`TrackEntry` decode, and the predicate split treating `Some(false)` flags as default-presentation while `Some(true)` triggers the accessibility / non-default surface.
- demux: **typed per-Cluster `Position` / `PrevSize` records** (RFC 9559 §5.1.3.2 / §5.1.3.3). New `MkvDemuxer::cluster_records() -> &[ClusterRecord]` surfaces each Cluster's optional `Position` (id `0xA7`, `uinteger`) and `PrevSize` (id `0xAB`, `uinteger`) children as they're walked. Records are appended in first-encounter order through `next_packet` / `seek_to` and keyed by `body_offset` (the absolute file offset of the byte right after the Cluster's id+size header — the dedup key, so a back-then-forward seek that revisits the same Cluster doesn't push a duplicate row). Both typed fields are `Option<u64>`: `None` when the on-disk child was absent (common for `PrevSize` on the first Cluster of a Segment, and for both fields when a writer omitted them entirely), `Some(v)` when present. The `Some(0)` `Position` case is the §5.1.3.2 spec convention for live streams (offset not determined ahead of time) — distinct from `None`. Consumers can verify a recorded `Position` matches the actual on-disk offset by subtracting `segment_data_start` + the Cluster's header length from `body_offset` (the §16 Segment-Position definition), build a reverse walker on top of `PrevSize` without re-scanning the SeekHead, or detect a live stream by seeing `Some(0)` `Position` values. The slice grows incrementally — callers wanting the full per-Cluster set should drain the file via `next_packet` (or seek to every Cluster of interest) first. New `ids::POSITION` / `ids::PREV_SIZE` constants (`0xA7` / `0xAB`) plumb the element ids through to the Cluster walker. Pinned by 6 new `tests/cluster_records.rs` cases covering the empty-slice surface before any walk, two-Cluster capture preserving on-disk order with mixed present/absent fields, the all-`None` no-children surface, the `Some(0)` live-stream `Position` distinct from `None`, the `body_offset → Position` derivation matching the §16 Segment-Position definition exactly (built bytes-out so offsets are known), and the dedup contract across repeat `next_packet` walks past EOF.
- demux: **typed `Targets::target_level()` hierarchy resolver** (RFC 9559 §5.1.8.1.1.1, Table 33). New `Targets::target_level() -> Option<TargetLevel>` maps the raw `target_type_value: Option<u64>` field through the typed `TargetLevel` enum: `Shot=10` / `Subtrack=20` / `Track=30` / `Part=40` / `Album=50` / `Edition=60` / `Collection=70`, plus `Other(u64)` for values registered under the §27.13 "Matroska Tags Target Types" registry after RFC 9559. The enum derives `Ord` in spec-containment order (lowest to highest), so the §5.1.8.1.1.1 usage note ("Higher values MUST correspond to a logical level that contains the lower logical level TargetTypeValue values") falls straight out of comparison; `Other(_)` sorts after every named level so a forward-compat entry doesn't break the rule for the named ones. Returns `None` when the on-disk `TargetTypeValue` element was absent — distinguishable from `Some(TargetLevel::Album)` (= the spec default `50` materialised explicitly by a writer). Companion methods: `TargetLevel::from_raw(u64)` constructs the enum; `TargetLevel::to_raw() -> u64` is the lossless inverse covering every named variant and the `Other(u64)` forward-compat passthrough; `TargetLevel::canonical_label() -> Option<&'static str>` returns the leftmost / most common Table 33 label for the level (`ALBUM` for value `50`, not the alternate `OPERA` / `CONCERT` / `MOVIE` / `EPISODE` labels — the integer is the canonical hierarchy key and the string is purely a display hint). The file's own `TargetType` informational string remains accessible verbatim on the existing `Targets::target_type` field; the typed level helper doesn't overwrite it. Pinned by 7 new `tests/tags.rs` cases covering the seven named round-trips (`Shot` / `Subtrack` / `Track` / `Part` / `Album` / `Edition` / `Collection` against raw `10` / `20` / `30` / `40` / `50` / `60` / `70` with their canonical Table 33 labels), the `Other(u64)` forward-compat passthrough across `[1, 25, 55, 80, 90, 100, 1_000, u64::MAX]`, the `Ord` chain `Shot < Subtrack < Track < Part < Album < Edition < Collection < Other(1) < Other(2)`, an end-to-end demux of a Tag carrying `TargetTypeValue=30` + `TargetType="TRACK"` + resolved `TagTrackUID=0xA1` mapping to `Some(TargetLevel::Track)`, the `None` surface when the `TargetTypeValue` element was absent, the `Other(25)` forward-compat surface when a Tag carries an unrecognised value, and the explicit-default case (`TargetTypeValue=50` + `TargetType="MOVIE"` → `Some(TargetLevel::Album)` with `canonical_label() == Some("ALBUM")` while `target_type` stays `Some("MOVIE")`).
- mux: **write-side `Colour > MasteringMetadata` sub-master** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.28.30..§5.1.4.1.28.40) via a new `mastering_metadata: Option<MkvMasteringMetadata>` field on `MkvVideoColour` and the new `MkvMasteringMetadata` payload struct (mux module). When `Some(_)`, the muxer emits a `MasteringMetadata` master (id `0x55D0`) inside the parent `Colour` master, after the existing `MaxCLL` / `MaxFALL` pair. Each of the ten chromaticity / luminance children — `PrimaryRChromaticityX/Y` (`0x55D1` / `0x55D2`), `PrimaryGChromaticityX/Y` (`0x55D3` / `0x55D4`), `PrimaryBChromaticityX/Y` (`0x55D5` / `0x55D6`), `WhitePointChromaticityX/Y` (`0x55D7` / `0x55D8`), `LuminanceMax` (`0x55D9`), `LuminanceMin` (`0x55DA`) — is written as an 8-byte big-endian `f64` only when its own `Option<f64>` slot is `Some(v)`, mirroring the per-child omission rules already in use for the scalar Colour children. Children are written in numerical-id order so the on-disk layout matches the order the demuxer walks them. A `Some(MkvMasteringMetadata::default())` (every slot `None`) serialises as an empty 3-byte `MasteringMetadata` master (id `0x55D0` + size VINT `0x80`) that the demuxer parses into `Some(MasteringMetadata::default())` — distinct from the slot-omitted case (`mastering_metadata: None`) which keeps the entire sub-master off-disk so the demuxer surfaces `None` from its `mastering_metadata()` accessor. Convenience constructor `MkvMasteringMetadata::bt2020_d65_hdr10()` populates the ten-child set with BT.2020 primaries (red `(0.708, 0.292)`, green `(0.170, 0.797)`, blue `(0.131, 0.046)`), D65 white point `(0.3127, 0.3290)`, 1000 cd/m² peak luminance and 0.005 cd/m² floor — the canonical HDR10 mastering display. The muxer does NOT validate the spec's `[0.0, 1.0]` chromaticity range or `>= 0` luminance range — out-of-range values reach disk verbatim so a producer mirroring a file with out-of-spec values can preserve them. Pairs symmetrically with the existing demux-side `MasteringMetadata` typed accessor — a mux→demux round-trip preserves every populated child. The write-path closes the §5.1.4.1.28.30 gap previously called out in this CHANGELOG under the §5.1.4.1.28.16 scalar-children entry (and the `## What's NOT implemented` README section): `MkvMuxer::set_video_colour` now covers `Colour` and `Colour > MasteringMetadata` end-to-end. Pinned by 8 new `tests/mux_video_colour.rs` cases covering the BT.2020 + D65 + 1000-nit / 0.005-nit canonical-HDR10 round-trip alongside the BT.2100 PQ scalar children carried in the same `Colour` master, the sparse-LuminanceOnly case with the remaining nine children staying `None` end-to-end, the omitted-slot `None` surface with an on-disk id-byte scan confirming `0x55D0` does not appear, the empty `MasteringMetadata` master surfacing as `Some(MasteringMetadata::default())` with a literal `[0x55, 0xD0, 0x80]` byte-walk pinning the 3-byte empty-master shape, ten independent per-child round-trips (distinct values per slot so any field-id transposition surfaces as the wrong number on the wrong getter), simultaneous round-trip alongside the `MaxCLL` / `MaxFALL` integer pair and the scalar Colour children (BT.2020 / PQ / full range / 10 bpc preserved), the muxer's own `video_colour(stream_index)` accessor returning the queued `MkvMasteringMetadata`, and the out-of-range chromaticity / luminance pass-through contract (`1.5` and `-1.0` reaching disk verbatim).
- demux: **typed `BlockAdditionMapping` decode** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.17). `MkvDemuxer::block_addition_mappings(stream_index)` (and the per-stream `all_block_addition_mappings()` slice) returns each `Tracks > TrackEntry > BlockAdditionMapping` master (id `0x41E4`) as a typed `BlockAdditionMapping` record with `value` (`BlockAddIDValue`, §5.1.4.1.17.1, id `0x41F0`, `Option<u64>` — spec range `>=2`, no default), `name` (`BlockAddIDName`, §5.1.4.1.17.2, id `0x41A4`, `Option<String>`), `addid_type` (`BlockAddIDType`, §5.1.4.1.17.3, id `0x41E7`, `u64` — §5.1.4.1.17.3 default `0` materialised), and `extra_data` (`BlockAddIDExtraData`, §5.1.4.1.17.4, id `0x41ED`, `Option<Vec<u8>>` — opaque per-track binary state the type interpreter consults). New `BlockAdditionMapping::is_codec_defined()` helper reports whether `addid_type == 0` (the §5.1.4.1.17.3 usage-note case in which the matching `BlockAddID` must be `1`). Multiple mappings per `TrackEntry` are preserved in on-disk order (the spec gives the master no `maxOccurs`); tracks with no `BlockAdditionMapping` child surface as an empty slice (the common case — the element only appears on tracks that use `BlockAdditional` to extend their on-disk format, e.g. WebM alpha at `BlockAddID == 1`, HDR dynamic metadata, or ITU-T T.35 frame-level metadata). Unknown child elements inside the master are skipped — the spec leaves the `BlockAddIDType` registry open for future additions. Per-frame `BlockAdditional` payload bytes remain owned by the codec / track-format extension; the container surfaces the *shape* of the side channel only. Pinned by 6 new `tests/block_addition_mapping.rs` cases covering the absent-master empty-slice surface, a single mapping with all four children, the §5.1.4.1.17.3 default-`0` materialisation on an empty mapping master, multiple mappings preserving document order, out-of-range `stream_index` returning an empty slice, and unknown-child skipping.
- mux: **write-side `Video > Colour` scalar children** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.28.16, §5.1.4.1.28.17..§5.1.4.1.28.29) via the new `MkvMuxer::set_video_colour(stream_index, MkvVideoColour)` builder method. Emits a `Colour` master (id `0x55B0`) inside the per-track `Video` master at `write_header` time, after the existing `UncompressedFourCC` block, carrying the eleven scalar children: `MatrixCoefficients` (`0x55B1`), `BitsPerChannel` (`0x55B2`), `ChromaSubsamplingHorz` / `ChromaSubsamplingVert` / `CbSubsamplingHorz` / `CbSubsamplingVert` (`0x55B3` / `0x55B4` / `0x55B5` / `0x55B6`), `ChromaSitingHorz` / `ChromaSitingVert` (`0x55B7` / `0x55B8`), `Range` (`0x55B9`), `TransferCharacteristics` (`0x55BA`), `Primaries` (`0x55BB`), `MaxCLL` (`0x55BC`), `MaxFALL` (`0x55BD`). New `MatrixCoefficients::to_raw()` / `ChromaSitingHorz::to_raw()` / `ChromaSitingVert::to_raw()` / `ColourRange::to_raw()` / `TransferCharacteristics::to_raw()` / `Primaries::to_raw()` inverse methods on the demux-side enums round-trip every Table 12 / Table 13 / Table 14 / Table 15 / Table 16 / Table 17 value plus the `Other(u64)` forward-compat variant (§27.10..§27.13 leave the registries open). Convenience constructors `MkvVideoColour::bt709()` (matrix `1` / transfer `1` / primaries `1` / broadcast range — the canonical SDR HD shape) and `MkvVideoColour::bt2020_pq()` (matrix `9` / transfer `16` / primaries `9` / full range / 10 bpc — the canonical HDR10 shape) cover the two everyday cases. Per-element omission rules implemented at write time: every scalar that equals its §5.1.4.1.28 spec default is left off-disk so the demuxer materialises the spec default; every `Option<u64>` (the four chroma-subsampling integers and the `MaxCLL` / `MaxFALL` pair, none of which have spec defaults) is written when `Some(v)` and skipped when `None`. As a result, queueing `MkvVideoColour::default()` writes an empty 3-byte `Colour` master (id `0x55B0` + size VINT `0x80`), which the demuxer parses into `Some(VideoColour::default())` with every getter returning the materialised spec default — distinguishable on disk from the call-was-omitted case, which keeps the `Colour` master off-disk entirely so the demuxer surfaces `None` from `video_colour`. Spec rules enforced at queue time: `set_video_colour` rejects calls made after `write_header`, out-of-range `stream_index`, and calls on non-video tracks. `MasteringMetadata` (§5.1.4.1.28.30..§5.1.4.1.28.40) is not yet emitted on the write side; this round covers the scalar Colour children only. Pinned by 25 new `tests/mux_video_colour.rs` cases covering the BT.709 SDR + HDR10 PQ round-trips, `MaxCLL` / `MaxFALL` integer pair, the four-element chroma-subsampling quartet, every `Other(u64)` forward-compat path through each of the six enum-typed children, `ChromaSitingHorz` / `ChromaSitingVert` explicit-non-default and shared `Half` round-trips, the Table 17 `EbuTech3213EJedecP22Phosphors` 12-to-22 spec-gap, the omitted-call `None` surface, the empty-Colour-master `Some(default)` surface (including a 3-byte literal walk for the empty master shape), on-disk element-id presence/absence (id-byte scan for `0x55B0`), every rejection contract (post-`write_header`, out-of-range stream index, audio-track), idempotent last-write-wins under repeated calls, the muxer's own `video_colour(stream_index)` accessor, audio-track index returning `None` even on a multi-track file, and independence from every other `Video` sub-element setter (interlacing, stereo, alpha, geometry, UncompressedFourCC).
- mux: **write-side `Video > UncompressedFourCC`** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.28.15) via the new `MkvMuxer::set_video_uncompressed_fourcc(stream_index, [u8; 4])` builder method. Emits `UncompressedFourCC` (id `0x2EB524`, `binary`, schema-fixed `length: 4`) inside the per-track `Video` master at `write_header` time, after the existing `PixelCrop*` / `Display*` block. The setter takes a `[u8; 4]` array directly so the §5.1.4.1.28.15 schema's fixed length is enforced at the type system rather than at queue time, and every byte (including high bytes and `0x00`) is written verbatim — the element is `binary`, not `string`, and the muxer never treats the four-byte payload as text. Spec rules enforced at queue time: `set_video_uncompressed_fourcc` rejects calls made after `write_header`, out-of-range `stream_index`, and calls on non-video tracks. Omitting the call leaves the element off-disk so the demuxer's `MkvDemuxer::video_uncompressed_fourcc` surfaces `None` — §5.1.4.1.28.15 defines no default, and Table 11's `minOccurs=1` pin only fires for `CodecID == "V_UNCOMPRESSED"`, which the muxer does not presently emit. Pairs symmetrically with the existing `MkvDemuxer::video_uncompressed_fourcc` typed accessor — a mux→demux pipeline preserves the four-byte FourCC bit-exactly. Pinned by 13 new `tests/mux_video_uncompressed_fourcc.rs` cases covering printable / non-printable / high-byte FourCC round-trips (`YUY2`, `BGRA`, `NV12`, the `[0xFF, 0x00, 0x12, 0xAB]` binary-passthrough), the omitted-call `None` surface, on-disk element-id presence/absence (id-byte scan for `0x2EB524`), an explicit element-header literal walk confirming size VINT `0x84` + a four-byte payload, every rejection contract (post-`write_header`, out-of-range stream index, audio-track), idempotent last-write-wins under repeated calls, the muxer's own `video_uncompressed_fourcc(stream_index)` accessor returning the queued value pre-`write_header`, and independence from `set_video_geometry` (setting one does not affect the other).
- mux: **write-side `Video` geometry quartet** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.28.8..§5.1.4.1.28.14) via the new `MkvMuxer::set_video_geometry(stream_index, MkvVideoGeometry)` builder method. Emits `PixelCropTop` (id `0x54BB`) / `PixelCropBottom` (id `0x54AA`) / `PixelCropLeft` (id `0x54CC`) / `PixelCropRight` (id `0x54DD`) plus `DisplayWidth` (id `0x54B0`) / `DisplayHeight` (id `0x54BA`) / `DisplayUnit` (id `0x54B2`) inside the per-track `Video` master at `write_header` time, alongside the existing `PixelWidth` / `PixelHeight`. New `DisplayUnit::to_raw()` inverse method on the demux-side enum round-trips every Table 10 value (`Pixels` / `Centimeters` / `Inches` / `DisplayAspectRatio` / `Unknown`) plus the `Other(u64)` forward-compat variant (§27.9 leaves the "Matroska Display Units" registry open). Per-element omission rules implemented at write time: zero crops stay off-disk so the demuxer materialises the §5.1.4.1.28.8..11 default `0`; `DisplayWidth` / `DisplayHeight` are written when `Some` and skipped when `None`; `DisplayUnit` is written explicitly only for non-`Pixels` values, so a producer re-muxing a file that did not carry an explicit `DisplayUnit` stays byte-faithful to the §5.1.4.1.28.14 default-omission case. Convenience constructors `MkvVideoGeometry::cropped(top, bottom, left, right)` (the RFC 9559 §11.1 pillar-box / letterbox shape, no display-size override, `Pixels` unit) and `MkvVideoGeometry::aspect_ratio(num, den)` (`DisplayUnit::DisplayAspectRatio` + the ratio encoded as `DisplayWidth` / `DisplayHeight`) cover the two common shapes. Spec rules enforced at queue time: `set_video_geometry` rejects calls made after `write_header`, out-of-range `stream_index`, calls on non-video tracks, and `Some(0)` on either `display_width` / `display_height` per the §5.1.4.1.28.12 / .13 `range: not 0` pin. Pinned by 15 new `tests/mux_video_geometry.rs` cases covering the pillar-box round-trip with derived-default display dimensions (`PixelWidth - cropLeft - cropRight = 1440` for the 1920x1080 worked example), four-axis non-zero crop round-trips, the aspect-ratio override shape, `DisplayUnit::Other(u64)` and `Centimeters` round-trips, the absent-dimension + non-Pixels-unit `None` surface, the omitted-call spec-default path with on-disk element-id absence scan, the `DisplayUnit::Pixels` default-omission rule, every rejection contract, idempotent last-write-wins under repeated calls, and the typed `video_geometry(stream_index)` accessor.
- mux: **write-side `Video > StereoMode` + `AlphaMode`** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.28.3 + §5.1.4.1.28.4) via the new `MkvMuxer::set_video_stereo_mode(stream_index, StereoMode)` and `MkvMuxer::set_video_alpha_mode(stream_index, AlphaMode)` builder methods. Emits `StereoMode` (id `0x53B8`) and `AlphaMode` (id `0x53C0`) inside the per-track `Video` master at `write_header` time, immediately after the existing `FlagInterlaced` / `FieldOrder` pair. New `StereoMode::to_raw()` / `AlphaMode::to_raw()` inverse methods on the demux-side enums round-trip every Table 5 / Table 6 value plus the `Other(u64)` forward-compat variant (§27.7 / §27.8 leave both registries open). Spec rules enforced at queue time: both setters reject calls made after `write_header`, out-of-range `stream_index`, and calls on non-video tracks. Calling `set_video_stereo_mode(_, StereoMode::Mono)` / `set_video_alpha_mode(_, AlphaMode::None)` explicitly still writes the element on disk so producers can override downstream defaults; omitting the call entirely leaves the element off-disk so the demuxer materialises the §5.1.4.1.28.3 default `0` (Mono) / §5.1.4.1.28.4 default `0` (None). Pinned by 21 new `tests/mux_video_stereo_alpha.rs` cases covering side-by-side / top-bottom / anaglyph / both-eyes-laced / `Other(u64)`-passthrough round-trips, the omitted-call spec-default path, on-disk element-id presence/absence (id-byte scan), every rejection contract, idempotent last-write-wins under repeated calls, and the independence between StereoMode and AlphaMode settings.
- mux: **write-side `Video > FlagInterlaced` + `FieldOrder`** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.28.1 + §5.1.4.1.28.2) via the new `MkvMuxer::set_video_interlacing(stream_index, FlagInterlaced, Option<FieldOrder>)` builder method. Emits `FlagInterlaced` (id `0x9A`) and `FieldOrder` (id `0x9D`) inside the per-track `Video` master at `write_header` time, alongside the existing `PixelWidth` / `PixelHeight`. New `FlagInterlaced::to_raw()` / `FieldOrder::to_raw()` inverse methods on the demux-side enums round-trip every Table 3 / Table 4 value (`Undetermined` / `Interlaced` / `Progressive` + `Progressive` / `Tff` / `Undetermined` / `Bff` / `TffInterleaved` / `BffInterleaved`) plus the `Other(u64)` forward-compat variant. Spec rules enforced at queue time: `set_video_interlacing` rejects calls made after `write_header`, out-of-range `stream_index`, calls on non-video tracks, and `FieldOrder` paired with anything other than `FlagInterlaced::Interlaced` (§5.1.4.1.28.2's "If FlagInterlaced is not set to 1, this element MUST be ignored"). Omitting the call leaves both elements off-disk so the demuxer materialises the §5.1.4.1.28.1 default `0` (Undetermined) / §5.1.4.1.28.2 default `2` (Undetermined). Pinned by 14 new `tests/mux_video_interlacing.rs` cases covering TFF / BFF / progressive / default-FieldOrder / `Other(u64)`-passthrough round-trips, the omitted-call spec-default path, on-disk element-id presence/absence, every rejection contract, and idempotent last-write-wins under repeated calls.
- mux: write a leading `CRC-32` child (RFC 8794 §11.3.1, RFC 9559 §6.2) on every Top-Level master the muxer buffers end-to-end before flushing — `Info`, `Tracks`, `Cues`, plus `Chapters` and `Attachments` when those are queued. 6-byte on-disk shape (`0xBF` id + `0x84` size VINT + 4 LE payload bytes); `SeekHead` is deliberately not CRC'd because its Cues entry is patched in `write_trailer`; `Cluster` is not CRC'd because the muxer streams Clusters with the unknown-size VINT and RFC 8794 §11.3.1 requires a bounded body. Round-trip tests assert every emitted CRC validates through `MkvDemuxer::crc_status()`.
- demux: validate a leading `CRC-32` child on the late best-effort `Cues` rescan (the path used when `Cues` sits after the final `Cluster` — the common single-pass-mux layout). Statuses surface through the existing `crc_status()` accessor with `element_id == ids::CUES`, closing the previously-documented gap.
- mux: write-side `Attachments` (RFC 9559 §5.1.6) via `MkvMuxer::add_attachment` + `MkvAttachment`. `AttachedFile` children written in demux parse order (`FileDescription`/`FileName`/`FileMediaType`/`FileData`/`FileUID`); `FileUID` auto-derives from the 1-based attachment index when caller passes `None`, and explicit `Some(0)` is rejected per spec `range: not 0`. SeekHead extended to 5 entries (Info/Tracks/Chapters/Attachments/Cues); the new Attachments slot is either patched to the real element offset or voided when no attachments were queued.

### Other

- demux: **per-Cluster CRC-32 validation** (RFC 8794 §11.3.1, RFC 9559
  §6.2). Each `Cluster` carrying a leading `CRC-32` child is now checked
  against its body the first time the demuxer opens it — through the
  legacy `next_packet` walk or through a Cue-driven `seek_to`. Statuses
  surface through the existing `MkvDemuxer::crc_status() -> &[CrcStatus]`
  accessor with `element_id == ids::CLUSTER`. A body-offset dedup keeps a
  back-then-forward seek revisiting the same Cluster from producing two
  statuses for it, and a Cluster declared with the unknown-size VINT
  produces no status (the RFC requires a bounded body). Validation is
  informational — a mismatch never blocks packet emission. Mirrors the
  up-front Top-Level master check that already covered Info / Tracks /
  Tags / Cues / Chapters / Attachments / SeekHead. Closes the
  `What's NOT implemented` "per-Cluster CRC-32 children are not yet
  validated" bullet.
- demux: **typed decode for the three remaining `Video` sub-elements**:
  `AlphaMode` (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.28.4), `AspectRatioType` (Appendix
  A.24, reclaimed), and `UncompressedFourCC` (§5.1.4.1.28.15). New
  accessors `MkvDemuxer::video_alpha_mode(stream_index) ->
  Option<AlphaMode>`, `video_aspect_ratio_type(stream_index) ->
  Option<u64>` and `video_uncompressed_fourcc(stream_index) ->
  Option<&UncompressedFourCC>` (plus matching slice accessors). The
  spec default `0` (`AlphaMode::None`) is materialised so an empty
  `Video` master decodes as `Some(AlphaMode::None)`, distinguishable
  from `None` (no `Video` master at all); values outside Table 6 pass
  through `AlphaMode::Other(u64)` per the §27.8 open registry, and a
  convenience `AlphaMode::has_alpha()` returns `true` exactly for
  `Present`. `AspectRatioType` is exposed as the raw `u64` (the
  reclaimed appendix enumerates no values) and has no spec default —
  `None` on absence. `UncompressedFourCC` exposes the verbatim on-disk
  bytes via `as_bytes()` plus `fourcc() -> Option<[u8; 4]>` and
  `as_str() -> Option<String>` (UTF-8 lossy) accessors that return
  `None` whenever the on-disk payload isn't exactly 4 bytes; a
  malformed non-4-byte payload is preserved verbatim so a caller
  debugging a writer issue can still see what was emitted. Pinned by
  12 new `tests/video_alpha_aspect_fourcc.rs` cases covering AlphaMode
  present / default-none / other-passthrough / audio-track-returns-none;
  AspectRatioType present / absent / audio-track; UncompressedFourCC
  present / absent / malformed-length-preserved / audio-track; and a
  combined "three video elements together" round-trip. With this
  change every `Video` sub-element registered under RFC 9559 plus
  Appendix A.24 now surfaces on the demuxer's typed side.

- demux: **typed `Video > Projection` decode** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.28.41,
  including §5.1.4.1.28.42..§5.1.4.1.28.46). New
  `MkvDemuxer::video_projection(stream_index) -> Option<&Projection>`
  (plus the per-stream `video_projections()` slice) folds the
  `Projection` master's children into a single typed `Projection`.
  `ProjectionType` surfaces as a typed enum
  (`Rectangular` / `Equirectangular` / `Cubemap` / `Mesh` /
  `Other(u64)` for values registered after RFC 9559 — §27.15 leaves the
  registry open). `ProjectionPrivate` (the verbatim ISOBMFF box body —
  `equi` / `cbmp` / `mshp` — that pairs with the projection type)
  surfaces verbatim as `Option<&[u8]>`. The yaw / pitch / roll pose
  triple (degrees) surfaces as three `f64`s. Spec defaults are
  materialised: an empty `Projection` master decodes as a fully-typed
  identity projection (rectangular + zero pose), distinguishable from
  `None` (which means "no `Projection` master at all" — the common case
  for ordinary 2D video). Convenience helpers `ProjectionType::is_spherical()`
  and `Projection::is_rotated()` provide the headline yes/no answers.
  Non-video tracks (and video tracks with no `Projection` child) return
  `None`. Pinned by 10 new `tests/video_projection.rs` cases covering:
  the missing-Projection `None` contract; empty-Projection default
  materialisation; round-trip of every Table 18 value plus the
  `Other(u64)` forward-compat slot; the verbatim 12-byte `equi`-shaped
  `ProjectionPrivate` payload; the §5.1.4.1.28.46 worked example
  `<Projection><ProjectionPoseRoll>90</ProjectionPoseRoll></Projection>`
  (signalling a 90° counter-clockwise rotation); 4-byte float pose
  storage as an alternative to 8-byte; the audio-track-has-no-projection
  predicate; forward-compat skip of an unknown sub-element inside
  `Projection`; and the out-of-range `stream_index` `None` contract.

- ebml: **harden `ebml::skip` against forged oversize sizes**. The
  helper now reads `stream_position()`, computes the target with a
  saturating add, and calls `SeekFrom::Start(target)` instead of the
  prior `SeekFrom::Current(n as i64)`. EBML `Size` VINTs can reach
  `2^56 - 2` and the unknown-size sentinel (`VINT_UNKNOWN_SIZE`) is
  `u64::MAX` itself — both wrap `n as i64` to a negative value when
  the old impl cast it for the relative seek, letting a forged size
  rewind the reader and stall the demuxer in a loop. The new impl
  seeks past EOF on an attacker-controlled size (which is fine — the
  next read returns `UnexpectedEof`) and never moves backwards. Pinned
  by sixteen new `tests/injection_robustness.rs` tests covering: the
  bare `skip(huge)` / `skip(u64::MAX)` no-rewind contract; demux-open
  rejection of empty input, EBML-magic-with-truncated-header, an
  oversize EBML-header `Size`, an oversize `DocType` string, an
  oversize `CodecID` on a `TrackEntry`, an oversize `TagString` body,
  and a `Segment` whose declared size extends past EoF;
  `next_packet`-time handling of an oversize-`Size` `SimpleBlock`,
  a Xiph-laced `SimpleBlock` whose declared sub-frame sizes overrun
  the body, and a fixed-laced `SimpleBlock` with `n_frames = 5` over
  an empty payload (zero-frame-size edge case); on-demand
  `attachment_data` short-read on a forged 4 GiB `FileData` size and a
  forged 2 GiB `FileName` string; out-of-range `CueRelativePosition`
  in `seek_to`; and a small inline fuzz-corpus replay of five
  malformed seed shapes. Mirrors the round-162 mov / dds robustness
  pattern. No behaviour change on conforming inputs.
- demux: **typed `Video > StereoMode` decode** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.28.3).
  New `MkvDemuxer::video_stereo_mode(stream_index) -> Option<StereoMode>`
  (and the slice-view `video_stereo_modes()`) returns the typed
  single-track stereo-3D packing for any video TrackEntry — full
  §5.1.4.1.28.3 Table 5 enum coverage (`Mono`, the four
  side-by-side / top-bottom / checkerboard / interleaved / anaglyph /
  both-eyes-laced variants) plus an `Other(u64)` variant for values
  registered after RFC 9559 (§27.7 leaves the registry open). The spec
  default `0` (`Mono`) is materialised, so a `Video` master with no
  explicit `StereoMode` decodes as `Some(StereoMode::Mono)`,
  distinguishable from `None` (track has no `Video` master at all).
  Convenience `StereoMode::is_stereo()` returns `true` for any non-`Mono`
  packing. Adds one element-id constant (`STEREO_MODE`) plus 15 Table-5
  value constants (`STEREO_MODE_*`), and five integration tests covering
  the default-Mono contract, a per-Table-5 round-trip across all 15
  registered values, multi-track + `Other(42)` forward-compat, the
  audio-track / no-`Video`-master contract, and out-of-range
  `stream_index` safety.
- demux: **typed `Video > Colour` decode** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.28.16,
  including §5.1.4.1.28.17..§5.1.4.1.28.40 sub-elements and the
  SMPTE 2086 / CTA-861.3 HDR `MasteringMetadata`). New
  `MkvDemuxer::video_colour(stream_index) -> Option<&VideoColour>` (and
  the slice-view `video_colours()`) folds `MatrixCoefficients`,
  `BitsPerChannel`, `Chroma{Subsampling,Cb}Subsampling{Horz,Vert}`,
  `ChromaSiting{Horz,Vert}`, `Range`, `TransferCharacteristics`,
  `Primaries`, `MaxCLL`, `MaxFALL` and the `MasteringMetadata` master
  (`PrimaryRGBChromaticity{X,Y}` × 6, `WhitePointChromaticity{X,Y}` × 2,
  `Luminance{Max,Min}`) into a single typed record. Enums surface unknown
  values via an `Other(u64)` variant for forward compatibility with §27
  registries; spec defaults are materialised on the typed surface
  (matrix / transfer / primaries default `2` = *unspecified*; chroma
  siting / range / bits-per-channel default `0`). Children with no spec
  default (chroma subsampling, MaxCLL/MaxFALL, every MasteringMetadata
  field) surface as `None` when absent. Adds 25 element-id constants
  (`COLOUR` through `LUMINANCE_MIN`) plus eight Table-13..16 value
  constants, and seven integration tests covering the no-Colour-master
  contract, empty-Colour-master defaults, a BT.709 SDR round-trip, a
  BT.2100 PQ HDR round-trip with full MasteringMetadata (8-byte floats),
  4-byte (f32) MasteringMetadata with a sparse subset of children,
  unknown-enum-value passthrough via `Other(_)`, and the
  audio-track-has-no-Colour contract.
- demux: **typed `Video` geometry quartet decode** (RFC 9559
  §5.1.4.1.28.8..§5.1.4.1.28.14). New
  `MkvDemuxer::video_geometry(stream_index) -> Option<&VideoGeometry>`
  (and the slice-view `video_geometries()`) folds the
  `PixelCrop{Top,Bottom,Left,Right}` hide-window plus the `DisplayWidth` /
  `DisplayHeight` / `DisplayUnit` render-size triple into a single typed
  record. `DisplayUnit` surfaces as the `DisplayUnit` enum (`Pixels` /
  `Centimeters` / `Inches` / `DisplayAspectRatio` / `Unknown` /
  `Other(u64)` for forward-compatibility with the §27.9 "Matroska Display
  Units" registry). `display_width()` / `display_height()` return
  `Option<u64>` — the explicit element when present, otherwise the
  §5.1.4.1.28.12 / §5.1.4.1.28.13 derived default (`PixelWidth -
  PixelCropLeft - PixelCropRight` / `PixelHeight - PixelCropTop -
  PixelCropBottom`) when `DisplayUnit == 0` (pixels), and `None` for any
  other `DisplayUnit` per the spec note "else, there is no default value".
  The §5.1.4.1.28.8..11 PixelCrop defaults (`0`) and §5.1.4.1.28.14
  DisplayUnit default (`0`) are always materialised. Adds seven element-id
  constants (`PIXEL_CROP_{TOP,BOTTOM,LEFT,RIGHT}`, `DISPLAY_WIDTH`,
  `DISPLAY_HEIGHT`, `DISPLAY_UNIT`), five Table 10 value constants, and
  seven integration tests covering an explicit PixelCrop + Display pair,
  the bare-`Video`-master defaults path, derived display sizes after
  PixelCrops, a non-pixel `DisplayUnit` (DAR) with explicit values + a cm
  `DisplayUnit` with no DisplayWidth/Height (no-default path), an
  unregistered DisplayUnit surfacing as `Other(42)`, the
  audio-track-has-no-geometry contract, and a malformed-file
  underflow-returns-`None` case.
- demux: **typed `Video > FlagInterlaced` + `FieldOrder` decode** (RFC 9559
  §5.1.4.1.28.1 + §5.1.4.1.28.2). New
  `MkvDemuxer::video_interlacing(stream_index) -> Option<&VideoInterlacing>`
  (and the slice-view `video_interlacings()`) exposes a track's
  interlacing status — `FlagInterlaced` as the typed `FlagInterlaced` enum
  (`Undetermined` / `Interlaced` / `Progressive` / `Other(u64)`) paired
  with a `field_order()` accessor that returns `Some(FieldOrder)`
  (`Progressive` / `Tff` / `Undetermined` / `Bff` / `TffInterleaved` /
  `BffInterleaved` / `Other(u64)`) only when the track is actually
  interlaced. The §5.1.4.1.28.2 "If FlagInterlaced is not set to 1, this
  element MUST be ignored" rule is honoured by the typed surface: a stray
  `FieldOrder` on a progressive / undetermined track silently resolves to
  `None`. Spec defaults are materialised — a `Video` master with no
  `FlagInterlaced` child decodes as `FlagInterlaced::Undetermined` (the
  §5.1.4.1.28.1 default `0`), an interlaced track with no explicit
  `FieldOrder` decodes as `Some(FieldOrder::Undetermined)` (the
  §5.1.4.1.28.2 default `2`). Adds two element-id constants
  (`FLAG_INTERLACED`, `FIELD_ORDER`), nine value constants from Table 3 +
  Table 4, and four integration tests covering Tff-interlaced +
  progressive siblings, the bare-`Video`-master default path, the
  interlaced-with-default-FieldOrder + unknown-FieldOrder-value cases,
  and the audio-track-has-no-interlacing contract.
- demux: **typed decode of the `ChapProcess` sub-tree** (RFC 9559
  §5.1.7.1.4.14–§5.1.7.1.4.19). The typed `Chapter` now carries a
  `chap_processes: Vec<ChapProcess>` field exposing the chapter-codec
  commands (DVD-menu / Matroska-Script) attached to each `ChapterAtom`.
  New `ChapProcess` struct holds `codec_id` (`ChapProcessCodecID`, spec
  default `0` = Matroska Script materialised), `private`
  (`ChapProcessPrivate`, raw optional bytes) and `commands:
  Vec<ChapProcessCommand>`; each `ChapProcessCommand` carries `time`
  (`ChapProcessTime`, spec default `0` = "during the whole chapter") and
  `data` (`ChapProcessData`, raw command bytes). Payloads are surfaced
  verbatim — the container never executes a chapter command. Adds six
  element-id constants (`CHAP_PROCESS`, `CHAP_PROCESS_CODEC_ID`,
  `CHAP_PROCESS_PRIVATE`, `CHAP_PROCESS_COMMAND`, `CHAP_PROCESS_TIME`,
  `CHAP_PROCESS_DATA`) plus the Table 31 / Table 32 value constants, and
  one roundtrip integration test covering a DVD-menu process with private
  data + two timed commands alongside a Matroska-Script process that
  relies on the codec-id and time spec defaults.
- demux: **extend typed `Chapter` with RFC 9559 §5.1.7.1.4.5–§5.1.7.1.4.8
  sub-elements** previously dropped during the `Chapters` walk.
  `Chapter` now carries `enabled` (`ChapterFlagEnabled`, spec default `1`
  materialised as `true` so consumers don't special-case the absent
  element), `segment_uuid` (`ChapterSegmentUUID`, the raw 16-byte
  SegmentUUID for Medium-Linking Segments per §17.2), `segment_edition_uid`
  (`ChapterSegmentEditionUID`, with `0` suppressed to `None` per the spec's
  "range: not 0"), and `physical_equiv` (`ChapterPhysicalEquiv` —
  DVD/SIDE/etc. physical mapping per §20.4). Adds three element-id
  constants (`CHAPTER_SEGMENT_UUID`, `CHAPTER_SEGMENT_EDITION_UID`,
  `CHAPTER_PHYSICAL_EQUIV`) and a hand-rolled `Default` impl on `Chapter`
  so `Chapter::default().enabled == true` reflects the spec default.
  Adds two integration tests: one exercises every new field against a
  Medium-Linking-style atom alongside a vanilla sibling that verifies
  spec defaults, the other pins the `ChapterSegmentEditionUID = 0 → None`
  contract so the option can be the sole presence check downstream.
- demux: **typed `Attachments` accessor + on-demand payload reader** (RFC
  9559 §5.1.6). `MkvDemuxer::attachments() -> &[Attachment]` exposes the
  structured `AttachedFile` list the flat `attachment:N:*` metadata view
  collapses — every entry carries the 1-based `index` (matching the flat
  metadata keys and `tag:attachment:N:<name>` Tag scopes), `filename`
  (§5.1.6.2), `mime_type` (§5.1.6.3), `description` (§5.1.6.1), `uid`
  (§5.1.6.5), and the on-disk byte range (`data_offset` + `data_size`) of
  the `FileData` payload. The payload itself stays on disk until
  `MkvDemuxer::attachment_data(index)` is called — exactly `data_size`
  bytes are read from `data_offset` and the demuxer's reader position is
  restored across the fetch, so calling it between `next_packet` calls
  (or while mid-cluster) is safe. The flat `metadata()` view also gains
  an `attachment:N:description` key when the source element was present.
  Adds 5 integration tests (typed list fields, on-demand payload read with
  reader-position preservation, invalid-index rejection, FileDescription
  round-trip, empty-attachments case) and one new public type
  `demux::Attachment`.
- fuzz: **cargo-fuzz `demux` target** under `fuzz/fuzz_targets/demux.rs`,
  driving `demux::open` + `next_packet` + `seek_to(0, 0)` over arbitrary
  bytes from libFuzzer. Mirrors the ico / qoi / bmp harness shape: own
  `[workspace]`, dedicated `fuzz/Cargo.lock`, curated seed corpus in
  `fuzz/corpus/demux/` (minimal valid Matroska + WebM + EBML-header-only
  files, plus two regression seeds for the bugs found below).
  Scheduled daily via `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml` against the OxideAV
  reusable `crate-fuzz.yml` workflow (30-minute budget). The new
  harness drove five defensive demuxer fixes in the same commit:
  (1) `Cursor`-position + element-size arithmetic now uses
  `u64::saturating_add` in every `body_end = pos + e.size` /
  `ebml_end = pos + hdr.size` site so a crafted u64 VINT size cannot
  overflow the loop bound (caught by an EBML header where the declared
  body extended past `u64::MAX`);
  (2) `parse_fixed_lacing` now returns `n_frames` empty sub-frames
  when `frame_size == 0` instead of calling `<[T]>::chunks_exact(0)`,
  which panics — caught by a `SimpleBlock` with the fixed-lacing flag
  set and a one-byte body; (3) `parse_ebml_lacing` and
  `parse_xiph_lacing` now use checked arithmetic for the
  remaining-bytes / cumulative-size computation so neither integer
  overflow nor a debug-build subtract-with-overflow can panic on
  contrived lacing-header bytes; (4) `ebml::read_bytes` /
  `read_string` now use `Read::take(n).read_to_end()` so the
  allocation grows with actually-readable bytes — a 2^56-byte VINT
  size on a 1 KB input now allocates 1 KB and returns
  `UnexpectedEof`, not multi-terabyte vector growth; (5)
  `parse_chapter_atom` recursion is capped at depth 64 to prevent a
  pathologically nested `Chapters` tree from blowing the
  libfuzzer-sized stack. 19 M fuzz iterations clean post-fix
  (3-minute local run).
- demux + mux: **`CueRelativePosition` round-trip** (RFC 9559
  §5.1.5.1.2.3). The demuxer parses `CueRelativePosition` from each
  `CueTrackPositions` and, when present, repositions the input reader
  directly at the referenced `SimpleBlock` / `BlockGroup` inside the
  target Cluster on `seek_to` (instead of returning the first block of
  the Cluster). The Cluster's `Timestamp` (RFC 9559 §5.1.3.1) is
  captured first so block timecodes remain decodable. Out-of-range or
  malformed positions degrade gracefully to the legacy
  scan-from-cluster-start path. The muxer now writes
  `CueRelativePosition` for every Cues entry it emits — measured from
  the first possible element position inside the Cluster (i.e.
  immediately after the Cluster id+size header). Adds 6 integration
  tests covering middle / last / first / out-of-range positions, the
  muxer's on-disk Cues bytes, and a full mux→demux round-trip.
- demux: **typed `Chapters` accessor** (RFC 9559 §5.1.7).
  `MkvDemuxer::chapters() -> &[Edition]` exposes the structured chapter
  tree the flat `chapter:N:*` metadata view collapses. Every
  `EditionEntry` keeps its `EditionUID`, `EditionFlagDefault` and
  `EditionFlagOrdered` flags; every `ChapterAtom` keeps its
  `ChapterUID`, `ChapterStringUID`, full-precision `ChapterTimeStart` /
  `ChapterTimeEnd` nanoseconds, `ChapterFlagHidden`, all multilingual
  `ChapterDisplay` rows (`ChapString` + `ChapLanguage` /
  `ChapLanguageBCP47` + `ChapCountry`), and any nested child atoms
  (the spec marks `ChapterAtom` as recursive). Atoms are 1-indexed
  depth-first in document order — the same index the flat
  `chapter:N:*` keys and `TagChapterUID`-resolved tags use, now extended
  to nested chapters (previously only top-level atoms got an index).
  Adds `EDITION_FLAG_DEFAULT` / `EDITION_FLAG_ORDERED` /
  `CHAPTER_STRING_UID` / `CHAP_LANGUAGE_BCP47` element IDs.
- demux: **apply Header-Stripping on read** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.31.6 algo 3,
  §5.1.4.1.31.7). Header Stripping is the one `ContentEncoding` transform
  the container can reverse without a codec: the `ContentCompSettings` bytes
  were stripped from the front of each frame on write, so the demuxer now
  prepends them back and `next_packet` returns the original frame data.
  Block scope (§5.1.4.1.31.3 bit 0x1, "all frame contents excluding lacing
  data") is honoured per de-laced frame; a chain of multiple Header-
  Stripping steps is combined in decode order (highest `ContentEncodingOrder`
  first, §5.1.4.1.31.2). When the Block-scoped chain contains a step the
  container can't undo (zlib / bzlib / lzo1x compression or encryption) the
  packet passes through encoded rather than being partially stripped, and a
  Private-scope (`CodecPrivate`-only, bit 0x2) Header-Stripping leaves frame
  data untouched. zlib/bzlib/lzo1x decompression and decryption remain out
  of container scope.
- demux: **`ContentEncodings` typed decode** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.31). A
  track's per-frame transformation chain (compression and/or encryption
  applied to frame data / `CodecPrivate` before the bytes hit Blocks) now
  surfaces through `MkvDemuxer::content_encodings(stream_index)` and the
  per-stream `all_content_encodings()` slice. Each `ContentEncoding`
  carries its `ContentEncodingOrder`, a `ContentEncodingScope` bit field
  (`block()` / `private()` / `next()`), and a `ContentEncodingTransform`
  enum — `Compression { algo: ContentCompAlgo, settings }` (§5.1.4.1.31.5,
  algo `Zlib` / `Bzlib` / `Lzo1x` / `HeaderStripping` / `Other`, settings
  carrying the header-stripping bytes per §5.1.4.1.31.7) or `Encryption
  { algo: ContentEncAlgo, key_id, aes_cipher_mode }` (§5.1.4.1.31.8, algo
  `None` / `Des` / `TripleDes` / `Twofish` / `Blowfish` / `Aes` / `Other`,
  `ContentEncKeyID` bytes, and the nested `ContentEncAESSettings`
  `AESSettingsCipherMode` as `Ctr` / `Cbc` / `Other`). The list is
  pre-sorted into decode order (highest `ContentEncodingOrder` first per
  §5.1.4.1.31.2) and element defaults are honoured (order 0, scope 0x1
  Block, type 0 compression, comp-algo 0 zlib). Parse-only: the demuxer
  surfaces the headers and never decompresses or decrypts a frame. New
  public `demux::{ContentEncodings, ContentEncoding, ContentEncodingScope,
  ContentEncodingTransform, ContentCompAlgo, ContentEncAlgo,
  AesCipherMode}` types.
- demux: **`TrackOperation` typed decode** (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.1.30). A
  virtual track assembled from other tracks now surfaces through
  `MkvDemuxer::track_operation(stream_index)` and the per-stream
  `track_operations()` slice. `TrackCombinePlanes` (§5.1.4.1.30.1) decodes
  into a `Vec<TrackPlane>` — each `TrackPlane` pairs a referenced track
  with its `TrackPlaneType` (`LeftEye` / `RightEye` / `Background`, with
  `Other(u64)` preserving FCFS-registry values per §27.17) — and
  `TrackJoinBlocks` (§5.1.4.1.30.5) into a `Vec<TrackRef>`. Every
  `TrackPlaneUID` / `TrackJoinUID` is resolved back to a `TrackRef`
  carrying both the on-disk `TrackUID` and the matching 0-indexed stream
  index (`None` for a dangling reference, kept rather than dropped). A
  `TrackPlane` missing its mandatory `TrackPlaneUID` and a zero
  `TrackJoinUID` ("not 0" per spec) are dropped. New public
  `demux::{TrackOperation, TrackPlane, TrackPlaneType, TrackRef}` types.
- demux: **CRC-32 validation** on Top-Level master elements (RFC 8794
  §11.3.1, RFC 9559 §6.2). When `Info` / `Tracks` / `Tags` / `Cues` /
  `Chapters` / `Attachments` / `SeekHead` carries a leading `CRC-32`
  child, the demuxer recomputes the IEEE CRC-32 (reflected poly
  `0xEDB88320`, init `0xFFFFFFFF`, final ones-complement, little-endian
  storage) over the rest of the element and records a `CrcStatus
  { element_id, stored, computed }`. New `MkvDemuxer::crc_status() ->
  &[CrcStatus]` accessor (with `CrcStatus::is_valid()`) surfaces the
  results. Validation is informational: a mismatch does not abort the
  open (RFC 8794 §12 lets a reader MAY-ignore the data); strict callers
  inspect the slice. New public `ebml::crc32_ieee` helper (table built
  at runtime — no numeric table transcribed). Pinned by the canonical
  `crc32("123456789") == 0xCBF43926` check value.
- mux: opt-in **block lacing** on write (RFC 9559 §5.1.4.5.5,
  §10.3). New `MkvMuxer::with_block_lacing(LacingMode)` aggregates
  same-track, same-keyframe-status consecutive frames into a
  single laced `SimpleBlock` — Xiph (255-additive octets), EBML
  (signed-VINT deltas), or fixed-size (no per-frame header).
  Defaults to `LacingMode::None` (one frame per Block, byte-
  identical with prior versions). Per-Block frame cap is 8;
  cluster boundaries flush. When opted in, the muxer writes
  `TrackEntry.FlagLacing = 1` and sets the LACING bits in the
  SimpleBlock flags byte per §10.2.
- demux: typed `MkvDemuxer::tags() -> &[Tag]` accessor exposes
  `Targets` (`TargetType` string + `TargetTypeValue` + resolved
  `TargetUid` references), per-`SimpleTag` language /
  `TagLanguageBCP47` / `TagDefault` flag, and binary `TagBinary`
  payloads (cover-art bytes etc.) that the legacy flat
  `metadata()` view drops. Multi-UID `Targets` masters preserve
  every resolvable reference; dangling non-zero UIDs are filtered
  out per RFC 9559 §5.1.8.1.1.3..§5.1.8.1.1.6. New
  `demux::open_typed` returns the concrete `MkvDemuxer` so callers
  can reach the new accessor; the trait-returning `demux::open`
  is unchanged.
- mux: add `Chapters` encoding (RFC 9559 §5.1.7). New
  `MkvMuxer::add_chapter(start_ns, end_ns, title)` queues an
  English-language `ChapterAtom`; `add_chapter_full(MkvChapter)`
  supports multilingual `ChapterDisplay` rows with optional
  `ChapCountry`. Chapters are materialised as one `EditionEntry`
  between Tracks and the first Cluster, with the SeekHead
  `Chapters` slot patched to its real offset (or voided if no
  chapters were queued). Unblocks DVD Phase 3b
  (chapter names from the IFO program-chain into MKV output).
- demux: resolve `Tags.Targets.Tag*UID` against track / chapter /
  attachment / edition UIDs and emit scope-prefixed metadata keys
  (`tag:track:N:<name>` etc.); unresolved non-zero UIDs are dropped per
  RFC 9559 §5.1.8.1.1.x

## [0.0.7](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-mkv/compare/v0.0.6...v0.0.7) - 2026-05-06

### Other

- drop stale REGISTRARS / with_all_features intra-doc links
- drop dead `linkme` dep
- registry calls: rename make_decoder/make_encoder → first_decoder/first_encoder
- auto-register via oxideav_core::register! macro (linkme distributed slice)

## [0.0.6](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-mkv/compare/v0.0.5...v0.0.6) - 2026-05-04

### Other

- emit SeekHead at top of Segment for Info / Tracks / Cues
- surface subtitle tracks with MediaType::Subtitle + map S_* codec ids
- surface Matroska Attachments in metadata
- surface Matroska Chapters in metadata
- replace never-match regex with semver_check = false
- migrate to centralized OxideAV/.github reusable workflows
- pin release-plz to patch-only bumps

### Added

- mux: emit `SeekHead` at the top of the Segment with Seek entries for
  Info, Tracks, and Cues. Players that pre-walk the SeekHead (mpv,
  Chromium) can now jump to Cues without scanning the file. The Cues
  SeekPosition is patched in `write_trailer` once the real Cues offset
  is known; if no packets were written, the Cues slot is rewritten as
  a Void so the SeekHead doesn't point at offset 0.
- demux: parse `Chapters` master element — chapter atoms now surface in
  `Demuxer::metadata()` as `chapter:N:start_ms` / `chapter:N:end_ms` /
  `chapter:N:title` keys (ns→ms, 1-indexed).
- demux: parse `Attachments` — `AttachedFile` entries surface as
  `attachment:N:filename` / `:mime_type` / `:size_bytes`. Payload bytes
  are skipped via seek (no allocation), so a multi-megabyte embedded
  font no longer pulls a copy into RAM just to read its filename.
- codec_id: map Matroska subtitle CodecIDs (`S_TEXT/UTF8`, `S_TEXT/SSA`,
  `S_TEXT/ASS`, `S_TEXT/WEBVTT`, `S_TEXT/USF`, `S_VOBSUB`, `S_HDMV/PGS`,
  `S_HDMV/TEXTST`, `S_DVBSUB`, `S_KATE`) to short oxideav codec ids
  both ways, so subtitle tracks no longer pass through as
  `mkv:S_TEXT/UTF8` opaque ids.

### Fixed

- demux: subtitle tracks (TrackType=17) now surface with
  `MediaType::Subtitle` rather than `MediaType::Data`. Downstream
  filtering / probing tools that key on `media_type == Subtitle` can
  now find them.
